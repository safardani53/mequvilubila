My fear is obvious. I am extremely claustrophobic and there was a lot going on in my life.</p><p>"I am fortunate as I have great doctors like Dr Amin Mirahdi and the amazing techs at cedar sinai. But that fear…. The turmoil….. the timing of it all…. This is what cancer can look like," she continued.</p><p>The gut-wrenching video showed Shannen crying while lying down with a mask covering the top of her head and her mouth as she bit on a popsicle stick.</p><h2>SUPPORTIVE FANS</h2><p>In the comments section of the video, fans have been showing their utmost support for the actress after sharing her latest diagnosis.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>One wrote: "You are a warrior, beautiful Shannen, and an inspiration to us all."</p><p>"I hope you can feel the love and prayers from all of us," a second wrote. "As a cancer survivor myself it’s a never ending journey. Stay strong and positive and surround yourself with the best people possible."</p><p>A third commented: "This is a lot. This is a lot to take on, still again. And I am wishing for all the wise peace you have learned to find you in the terror moments. To know we are holding you."</p><p>"You are so incredibly brave…and strong. Hope you can feel the love from so many of us!" said a fourth.</p><p>A fifth said: "I’m so sorry you’re going through this again. You’re a true warrior and it’s incredibly strong you share this with us."</p><p>Many fans also applauded Shannen for her bravery and vulnerability in sharing her story on social media.</p><h2>SHANNEN'S CANCER JOURNEY</h2><p>Shannen was first diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href=#>breast cancer</a>&nbsp;in 2015 and had previously gone into remission after a mastectomy and chemotherapy treatments.</p><p>In February 2020, court documents pertaining to her lawsuit <a href=#>revealed that the cancer was back.</a></p><p>"Plaintiff Shannen Doherty is dying of stage 4 terminal cancer," the court documents stated. "Instead of living out her remaining years peacefully in her home, Ms. Doherty remains displaced and battling with her insurance company."</p><p>On October 7, 2021, Shannen then opened up about her battle with the stage 4 breast disease in honor of&nbsp;<a href=#>Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</a></p><p><a href=#>Shannen posted two photos on Instagram</a>&nbsp;one was a selfie with her head bald from chemotherapy treatment and a bloody tissue in her nose while the other was of her sleeping.</p><p>"For breast cancer awareness month, I’d like to share more of my own personal journey from my first diagnosis to my second. Is it all pretty? NO but it’s truthful and my hope in sharing is that we all become more educated, more familiar with what cancer looks like," Shannen wrote in the caption.</p><p>She later went on to urge&nbsp;<a href=#>fans to get screened regularly</a>&nbsp;writing, "I hope I encourage people to get mammograms, to get regular checkups, to cut thru the fear and face whatever might be in front of you."</p><p>The month before, Shannen spoke to People magazine and said she felt compelled to speak out about what it was like living with&nbsp;<a href=#>cancer</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"I feel like I have a responsibility in my more public life, which I separate from my acting life … to talk about cancer and perhaps educate people more and let people know that people with stage 4 are very much alive and very active," she told the media outlet.</p><p>Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the&nbsp;<a href=#>United States</a>&nbsp;and affects more than 200,000 people a year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/90210s-shannen-doherty-reveals-keep-684595626.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/shannen-doherty-attends-cos-margaret-823320283.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/90210-ian-ziering-gabrielle-carteris-473643050.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwY2WEeYCSaKqhmZ6jsq95w6ifnqqkrnqnrc2sZK6oo5rBbq3FrZyrZZ6axG6vwKeanqpdmbais82oqqKrXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-apple-unrecognizable-pic-grown-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gwyneth Paltrow's daughter Apple, 17, looks unrecognizable in new pic as fans 'can't believe' how gr">&larr;
