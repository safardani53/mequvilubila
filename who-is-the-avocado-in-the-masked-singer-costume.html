Bride, the previous “Reigning Queen,” returned to defend her reign in the episode, along with two new characters, Snowstorm, and Avocado, who were presented to the audience. By the conclusion of the episode, Snowstorm had dethroned Bride, who was revealed to be professional wrestler Chris Jericho.</p><p>While many thought Avocado was Tim Allen, the Masked Singer competitor was revealed to be comedian Adam Carolla. Fans were surprised by the result since they were confident in their prediction. Not one, but the majority of fans had guessed Tim based on the several indications provided before Avocado’s performance. One user tweeted:</p><p>The episode’s official summary is as follows:</p><p>“The panelists mock each other as two new characters join the tournament; Drew Carey and Jon Lovitz make cameos.”</p><h2>Avocado is exposed in Season 8 Episode 8 of The Masked Singer.</h2><p>Bride, who was proclaimed the winner last week, returned to defend her title on tonight’s edition of The Masked Singer. Two new contenders, Snowstorm and Avocado, were up against her for the victory. Following Bride’s outstanding performance and many guesses from the judges, it was time for Avocado to take the stage and demonstrate his abilities.&nbsp;Avocado made careful to provide some hints about his identity for the audience to guess before his participation in the competition. He stated:</p><p>“Sure, I’m a hilarious man today, but I’m a long way from where I began.” I used to be a regular Joe who worked in construction. Jobs that need you to get your hands filthy. But I didn’t want to work outdoors all the time. I want an air-conditioned lifestyle and the ability to make others laugh.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Avocado-1.jpg alt=Avocado width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When fans learned that a Masked Singer candidate had previously worked in construction, they immediately assumed it was one of the Property Brothers (twins Jonathan and Drew Scott) or someone from a home renovation program. Avocado alluded discreetly to his transition from construction to comedy, saying:</p><p>“I found a friend who assisted me in exchanging my equipment for some delicious, sweet AC.” After some success, I wanted to broaden my horizons, so I embarked on an entirely new enterprise. It became into a multibillion-dollar business.”</p><p>Avocado also claimed that he used his stage debut to dedicate the “diss track to the comic who is legally obligated to appear on every FOX program,” Ken. A bald eagle smashing through the contestant’s apartment window, tools, and a microphone were among the visual cues.</p><p>Ray Charles’s hit “Hit the Road Jack” was sung by a Masked Singer competitor. Ken saw that Avocado was not performing for the first time on stage and that his performance made the crowd chuckle. While Jon Lovitz pointed out that even if the candidate was interested in house improvements, it couldn’t be a Property Brother since they are all gorgeous, Avocado had a face that people wanted to hear.</p><p>The following were the judges’ final choices for Avocado: Harrison Ford (Nicole), Joe Rogan (Nicole), Marc Maron (Jenny), or Tim Allen (Robin). The bride was exposed later in the program and revealed to be professional wrestler Chris Jericho. Avocado and Snowstorm competed in tonight’s Battle Royale, with the latter winning. Avocado’s identity was finally revealed to be comedian Adam Carolla.</p><h2>Were fans able to accurately identify Avocado?</h2><p>Avocado was popularly assumed to be Tim Allen by fans. They were taken aback when their prediction proved incorrect. Examine how they arrived at their estimate. They were, however, surprised to learn that their prediction was incorrect and that Adam Corolla was the correct answer.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Avocado.jpg alt=Avocado width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Season 8 of The Masked Singer had some thrilling performances as well as some surprising unmaskings. The battle only grows tougher as the season proceeds, as the champion tries to retain their title while the younger candidates strive to take it and escape being unmasked.&nbsp;Next Wednesday, November 23, 2022, Fox will air an all-new episode of The Masked Singer.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Adam Carolla?
