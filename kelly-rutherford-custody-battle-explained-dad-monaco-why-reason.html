Kelly, who&nbsp;appeared in court without her two children even though Judge Gesmer had ordered them to all be present, was told to immediately return the kids&nbsp;to their dad. They were forced to say goodbye in the New York City courthouse before leaving with Daniel’s mother. “She is a very well respected and very thorough judge,” Malcolm tells us. “And while things may not make sense on the surface the underlying issue, which a judge like Gesmer would consider, is what is in the best interests of the children. Usually that is done after very significant forensic and factual inquiry. It would appear even starting&nbsp;years ago, that there was a determination that it was better for the kids to be in Monaco with the father than in New York with&nbsp;their mother. I would believe that Judge Gesmer is merely facilitating what she believes is in the best interest of these children.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>[jwplatform aqE2U7bv]</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>But what does in the best interest of the children actually mean? According to Malcolm, who does not represent Kelly but has represented many individuals&nbsp;in custody battles over his career, tells us that it comes down to the “mental stability of each of the parents.” “The reality is of course what is the relative mental stability of each of the parents. What ability does the parent have to provide a consistent home environment. Does one parent attempt to alienate a child from the other parent? Where will the child receive the best education? And most importantly, a loving and caring, consistent environment.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>It all started in 2012 when a California judge ordered the children to “temporarily” be sent to live with their father during the year and their mother during the summers since his US work visa had been revoked. But ever since this “temporary” order had been issued, Kelly has been fighting it. Just recently, both the California and New York court system said they had no jurisdiction over this case which left Kelly perplexed and angered over why Judge Gesmer would order the children to be sent back to Monaco. Especially given the children and Kelly&nbsp;are not citizens of Monaco&nbsp;and neither is Daniel.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>ABC News’ media analyst and founder of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mediaite</a>, <strong>Dan Abrams</strong>, has been very vocal concerning Kelly’s case and has appeared with her several times on TV. “Kelly announces that since she can not get any court to enforce the terms of the California ruling, she isn’t sending the kids back and suddenly another New York judge determines that it actually does have jurisdiction to send Kelly’s kids back to Monaco?” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he told People Magazine</a>. “So that she can abide by the terms of a Monaco ruling? How is it possible that no U.S. court can enforce the specific terms and requirements of a U.S. ruling but a U.S. court can enforce the terms of one from Monaco? I really don’t get it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>So what can Kelly do next? She has a hearing scheduled in Monaco for Sept. 3 and Malcolm tells us she should definitely go there immediately and hire a local attorney to try and overturn this ruling there. She could also go to the New York State Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals to override Judge Gesmer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think this ruling is unfair?</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>— Chloe Melas</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH15e5BrZqSdnKHGbr7UrZ%2Beqpakv6V5wq6qraeUrnqjrdOto55lla29ra3Ip5ydZZSWsW65zqeYnKddrLW6edGemKynnmQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lizzo-nearly-bares-all-in-sexy-34th-birthday-photoshoot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lizzo Emerges From a Cake and Nearly Bares All in Birthday Photoshoot">&larr;
