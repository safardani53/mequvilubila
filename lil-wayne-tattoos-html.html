Duel, who had seen my work around South Beach, recommended me."</p><h2>The Most Iconic Tattoo Dow Hokoana Inked on Lil Wayne</h2><p>In the interview, Wayne's&nbsp;former&nbsp;tattoo artist said the tattoo of a&nbsp;cloud and a lightning bolt on his cheek,&nbsp;up by his temple, was the most iconic piece&nbsp;she did for him.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She described that the rapper once came to her and pointed to her daughter's book bag, where a&nbsp;lightning bolt was printed. And when she asked if he really wanted that, he customized the design and made the piece. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Hokoana further shared that she loved the tattoos made around his hip:</p><p>The one I liked best is on his hip. It’s one that people hardly see, but it wraps the whole side of his hip. It’s of 10 individual Vegas-style showgirls, some are just the head and headdress, some are full bodied. It’s really cool looking.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Dow Hokoana&nbsp;Completed Body Suit for Lil Wayne</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Hokoana took some time to complete the bodysuit for Lil Wayne.&nbsp;</p><p>The tattoo artist recalled having a conversation with&nbsp;Wayne about the approximate time to finish the suit. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She said that she had guessed it might take around three years in front of the rapper.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She eventually&nbsp;took&nbsp;three-and-a-half years to complete the bodysuit that covered every part of his body.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lil Wayne's Former Tattoo Artist Also Inked around His Sensitive Areas</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>During the same conversation,&nbsp;Hokoana admitted to making tattoos around the rapper's sensitive areas, like eye tattoos and tattoos around his&nbsp;crotch. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She said, "Even being a female all you can do is basically hold your own breath while tattooing [that area] because it's just... [makes a painful crying sound]."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She continued to add, "I've done this for a few clients. I'm sure [Wayne] was in pain, but he took it like a G. For real. It was&nbsp;yeeesh. But it happened. It took about 45 minutes. He's a G."</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Rapper Recently Added More Tattoos on His Face</h2><p>Besides the 300 tattoos made by&nbsp;Hokoana alone, the famed rapper has many other tattoos on his body.</p><p>Earlier this year, in March, he reportedly got a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">few more tattoos</a>&nbsp;on his face, with the help of&nbsp;celebrity tattoo artist Ivana Belakova. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The newest addition was&nbsp;a heartbeat right on top of his forehead.</p><p>Belakova, who has tattooed the likes of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Chris Brown</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>Quavo</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared a video</a> of&nbsp;Wayne getting&nbsp;some maintenance work and his new cross tattoo. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSZoXq4rdinnGaskanBsLvSZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./luna-bloom-tiktok-star-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Luna Bloom (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr;
