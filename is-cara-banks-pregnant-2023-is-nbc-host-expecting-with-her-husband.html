She joined the GOLF Channel in 2015 as a co-host and currently works for Golf Central.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cara-banks-golf.jpg><p>Banks has also worked internationally before moving to Orlando. She presented for the Golfing World in the UK and worked for Live @ Wimbledon, covering tennis grand slam.</p><p>Earlier this year, Banks also covered The Open and was one of the ground interviewers at Royal Liverpool, England. Previously, in 2017, Banks hosted the World Golf Hall of Fame Ceremony.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Cara Banks Pregnant 2023?</h2><p>The Golf Central host, Cara Banks, has announced she is pregnant for the third time. Banks shared the news with her followers on her Instagram handle.&nbsp;</p><p>The ever-so-gorgeous sports commentator shared a slide of pictures on her handle as she flaunted her baby bump proudly. The photo was taken in the NBC studio with one of her production crew members taking the snap.&nbsp;</p><p>Banks captioned the post, ” So we have got some news! Our last lil baby Banks is coming in March.” She also tagged her husband, Ollie Banks, in the post. Ollie hasn’t shared much information on his social media handle as he rarely uses it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cara-banks-pregnant-2023.jpg><p>The last post from Ollie’s account came earlier this year in February. In another slide, Banks could be seen with her two kids hugging her and putting their hands on her baby bump.&nbsp;</p><p>Cara also took to her X handle (formerly Twitter) to share the good news. Along with sharing the news of her pregnancy, Cara said she was happy to be part of the new Stifel Snow Show airing every Saturday on CNBC.</p><p>Soon after Cara shared the news, hundreds of congratulatory messages poured in for the host. Iona Stephen, the presenter for Sky Sports Golf, was one of the first people to congratulate Cara.</p><p>Elsie Lobb Dzingel was another big name to congratulate Cara on her happy news.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cara Banks Family: Husband & Kids</h2><p>The golf host, Cara Banks, is in a six-year happy married life with her husband, Ollie Banks. The couple tied the knot on October 7, 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>Cara had shared a few <a href=# rel=noopener>pictures</a> from her wedding ceremony on her X handle. Ollie also goes by Oliver Banks and has kept himself out of the public limelight.</p><p>From his Instagram handle, it is clear that Oliver shares the same passion for golf as his wife. He has shared a few pictures of him playing the sport and seems to be a huge supporter of the NFL team, the Las Vegas Raiders.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cara-banks-family.jpg><p>The couple welcomed their first child, Jesse Jagger Myles Banks, on June 1, 2019. Also on November 27, the couple celebrated their daughter, Antigone Joceyln’s second birthday.</p><p>Banks can be seen sharing cute family pictures on her Instagram handle. Cara and her two kids recently flew to Fairfield, Connecticut, to get into the festive mood.</p><p>She shared a video of her two kids and a bunch of other kids singing Christmas carols. Banks said Oliver couldn’t make the trip as he was busy with work in Florida. There are reports that the presenter’s husband is a businessman.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC10maamqqRYq%2BiusqsZKmqlZy7orrTZmlpamNitrR5zZuaZqCfqMFusdepnJysmaO0bsPIrZ9moJWneqnB0puYp5xf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./onlyfans-rich-list-earners.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="OnlyFans rich list: Stars making MILLIONS selling steamy snaps as Ulrika Jonsson considers signing u">&larr;
