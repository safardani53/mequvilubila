Both of his parents have given his work a lot of support.</strong></p><p>Jerick Deshun McKinnon, also known as “Jet,” was born on May 3, 1992, in Atlanta, Georgia.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Untitled-design-43.jpg><p>Jet is a football player for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). He is playing as a running back. The Minnesota Vikings drafted McKinnon in the third round of the 2014 NFL Draft.&nbsp;</p><p>During his rookie season, the running back became the Vikings’ first rookie to break the 100-yard mark since <a href=# rel=noopener>Adrian Peterson</a> in 2007.</p><p>McKinnon has also played for the San Francisco 49ers, where he suffered a knee injury in training camp. Later, on August 31, 2019, he was put on season-ending injured reserve.</p><p>The player attended Georgia Southern University, where he became the first All-SoCon. Additionally, Jerick was a Super Bowl champion (LVII).</p><h2>Jerick McKinnon Parents</h2><p>Jerick was born to Rungie and Frances in Georgia. His father, Rungie, was born on October 29, 1962.</p><p>According to various sources, Rungie previously worked as the CEO, CFO, and secretary at R. Custom Designs Inc., a company that was registered under his name on November 28, 1994, in Marietta, Georgia.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the company was dissolved in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sccrxxsb5adxufr82wbi.jpg><p>Similarly, Jerick’s mother, Frances Hudson McKinnon, was born on August 26, 1959. She was previously married to another man before Rungie.&nbsp;</p><p>In her previous relationship, she had a son named Lester Norwood, who is 12 years older than Jet.</p><p>Frances attended Pelham High School in Georgia for her early education. There, she played as a point guard for the basketball team, wearing Jersey No. 21.</p><p>In 2016, Jerick gave his mother a special gift by changing his jersey number to 21. Initially, he had worn Jersey No. 31 for the first two years before making the switch.</p><p>“Whatever she needs, I’ll do it with the snap of a finger,” he added. “I can’t really put into words how much I love my mother. She’s done so much for me and sacrificed a lot.”</p><h2>Are Lester And Jerick Related?</h2><p>Lester Norwood is the <a href=# rel=noopener>first son of Frances </a>and the half-brother of Jerick. Norwood is 12 years older than him.</p><p>Lester was born to Frances McKinnon and Lester Norwood II on August 23, 1980, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is also a football player like his younger brother. Norwood played football from 1998 until 2002.</p><p>In 1998, the half-brother started the Gators’ season opener against The Citadel, where he became the first UF true freshman to do so since Larry Kennedy in 1991.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/665257_10151154714442775_1944444721_o.jpg><p>After missing the whole 2001 season due to a neck injury, Lester&nbsp;returned to the Gators in 2002 and had his best statistical game with 11 tackles against Auburn.</p><p>Lester was ranked among the top 25 defensive backs in the country before winning a scholarship to the University of Florida.</p><p>The two brothers have a great relationship. Jerick has always looked up to his brother, Lester. Similarly, Lester is also very proud of his younger brother.&nbsp;</p><p>Once, Lester brought his brother into the Florida locker room. His teammates were excited to meet the young star, who was often scoring multiple touchdowns.</p><p>“I was always bragging, ‘My little brother scored five touchdowns in this game, five touchdowns in another game.’ Everyone wanted to meet him in the locker room,” Norwood said.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Question</h2><h3>How tall is Jerick McKinnon?</h3><p>Jerick McKinnon is 1.75 meters/ 5.7 ft tall.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC2xKugnKNdorCstc2npqdloJa%2FprrTrGSrrZ6ctqZ5xauYp5uVqHqur8qipaennmQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./matt-baier.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Matt Baier">&larr;
