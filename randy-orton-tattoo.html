His tattoo collection is as distinctive as his personality and is widely admired.</p><p>He has several tattoos with various meanings placed on his body, and here is all we know about it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Meanings behind Randy Orton’s tattoos</h2><p>It is reported that Orton has 11 tattoos spread across his body. While some are big and cover the entire part of his body, some are small yet significant.</p><p>The wrestler has two tattoos dedicated to his family. One is the ‘<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alanna</a>’ tattoo on his left forearm, inked after his daughter and her birthdate in Roman numerals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Randy-Orton-and-wife-tattoo.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Randy Orton’s matching tattoo with his wife, Kim. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>The second one is ‘<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim</a>,’ his current wife, on the middle finger of his left hand. Kim has also got a matching tattoo with Orton’s name inked on her middle finger.</p><p>Orton and his wife both have a second matching pair of tattoos. Kim got it on her right collarbone while Orton inked it on his left rib. Since no specific details are known, the matching tattoo remains a mystery.</p><p>Right above his ‘Alanna’ tattoo, Orton has inked a red rose for his daughter. “I have a rose here, the only color on any of my pieces is for my daughter Alanna, and her birthday there in Roma Numerals, and that’s the centerpiece, that’s what they all culminate to is that the rose right there on my arm for my daughter,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Orton has several tribal tattoos across his body, including his arms and back. The meaning behind them is basically protection against negative energy and evil forces.</p><p>He has Bible verses inked on the backside of his right arm. It is the Bible Verse 1 Peter 5:8 stating’, “Be Sober, Be Vigilant, Because Your Adversary The Devil, As A Roaring Lion, Walketh About Seeking Whom He May Devour.”</p><p>Orton’s entire arms are covered with skull tattoos near his tribal art. Initially, he had a United States Marine Corps tattoo on his left arm.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Unfortunately, the tattoo was badly received as people did not like the meanings behind it. As a result, Orton covered it up with the skull sleeves.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the skulls, there are several roses adorned in between. He noted that it took around 40-50 hours to get it done and had much meaning behind it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he asserted that he would never reveal it. He said, “As far as the meaning, I don’t want to tell everyone what it means. They can look, they can enjoy them, but the meaning is for me.”</p><p>Orton has a ‘Flying White Pigeon’ tattoo on his left arm. It has several meanings, including love, hope, harmony, good luck, and intimacy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lawsuit regarding Randy Orton’s tattoos</h2><p>One of the most well-known WWE wrestlers of all time, Orton is well-known to fans for having several tattoos. Some of Orton’s body tattoos were created by artist Catherine Alexander, who worked on him during the 2000s.&nbsp;</p><p>For using her tattoos on Orton’s character model in their games, Alexander decided to file a lawsuit against WWE, Take-Two Interactive Software, 2K Games, Visual Concepts Entertainment, Yuke’s, and others in 2018.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>2/ A jury found in favor of a tattoo artist for her copyright infringement claim against a video game company and others. These defendants recreated wrestler Randy Orton’s tattoos in a video game. <a href=# rel=noopener>@copyrightlately</a> gives the play-by-play and shared this photo in above link 👆🏽 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hFFFSGQkcg</a></p>— NeerMcD.eth 🚀 (@NeerMcD) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 1, 2022</a></figure><p>Alexander submitted trademark applications for these designs prior to suing WWE for violating the copyright on these special designs.</p><p>The drawings, according to Alexander, were reproduced for use in computer games by WWE and 2K without her consent or payment, even though they were shown on Orton’s body.&nbsp;</p><p>This sparked a conflict about the usage of these tattoos that lasted four years between the two parties before being resolved in 2022. Alexander had previously contacted WWE on their usage of her drawings while selling items like apparel, among other things.&nbsp;</p><p>She refused an offer of $450 dollars for the use of her designs, but there was a history between the two sides on this subject. The parties engaged in this conversation back in 2009, but there was no resolution.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The tattoo artist who designed Randy Orton's tattoos has won a lawsuit against Take-Two for recreating her artwork in the WWE 2K video games. She received $3,750 in damages after her designs being used without her permission in WWE 2K16, 2K17, and 2K18. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0pQDnJobjf</a></p>— SAY CHEESE! 👄🧀 (@SaycheeseDGTL) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 4, 2022</a></figure><p>However, WWE persisted in marketing Orton’s persona with the tattoos. At the end of this four-year lawsuit, the jury reached a number of findings, each of which had advantages and disadvantages for Alexander, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PWInsider</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The tattoo artist was right to pursue the issue legally since it was agreed that WWE used the tattoo designs in ways that went beyond fair use. She also received roughly $4,600 from this case.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9GapZ2xXaS%2FtbvNZquarKSkvHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sid-haig.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sid Haig - The Hollywood Gossip">&larr;
