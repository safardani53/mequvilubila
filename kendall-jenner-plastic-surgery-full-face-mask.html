I didn’t even address it at the time. Because if I address it, people are going to be like, ‘Oh, so she’s defending herself — she must be guilty.’”</p><p>She concluded: “As a model, why would I have my face reconstructed? It doesn’t even make sense.”</p><p>Kendall isn't the only family member to visit the doctor, as the <a href=#>Beverly Hills</a>-based surgeon has spoke about working with the famous family in the past and was even <a href=#>visited </a>by <a href=#>Scott Disick</a>, 38, in May.</p><p>Unlike Kendall, other members of the <a href=#>Kardashian</a> clan have been open about going under the knife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000689652596.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000605401702.jpg><h2><strong>KYLIE'S PLASTIC SURGERY</strong></h2><p>During a 2019 YouTube video, <a href=#>Kylie</a>, 24, addressed fan questions about the work she’s had done.</p><p>While she <a href=#>denied having breast implants and a nose job</a>, the makeup mogul has been open about using lip fillers.</p><p>In an episode of her reality show Life of Kylie, she revealed to having lip fillers due to "insecurities" with her appearance.</p><p>She continued to openly talk about the topic on KUWTK and even discussed the motivation for the first time she got fillers during the series finale reunion in June.</p><p>During the episode, she told moderator <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a>: "I think my love for makeup started with my insecurity with my lips.</p><p>"I had really small lips, and I didn't ever think about it until I had one of my first kisses and a guy said to me, 'Oh my God, you're such a good kisser, but you have such small lips,' or something like that.</p><p>"From then on, I felt unkissable."&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>KIM'S PROCEDURES</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kim,</a> 41, has also been known to use procedures to change her appearance.</p><p>The SKIMS mogul has admitted to using fillers and botox on her face over the years.</p><p>Back in 2017, plastic surgeon&nbsp;Dr David Shafer&nbsp;told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that the mother of four has used procedures to create "a softer, more refined look."</p><p>The doctor said: "Her cheeks appeared filled — likely a product such as Voluma or Vollure. Around her eyes also looks filled, which gives a smooth and youthful appearance.</p><p>"She likely has dermal filler in her lips. She likely has also had thermal energy-based treatments, which tightens and lifts the deeper tissue of the cheeks along the jawline and the neck. We also have to note that her makeup has become more sophisticated and professional compared to her earlier images."</p><h2><strong>KHLOE GOES UNDER THE KNIFE</strong></h2><p>More recently, Kendall's sister <a href=#>Khloe</a>, 37, explained how the family's introduction to fame led her to become insecure with her <a href=#>appearance</a>.</p><p>During the <a href=#>KUWTK reunion</a> in June, the mother of one said being called "fugly" by fans lowered her confidence.</p><p><a href=#>Khloe</a> said: "That's when I became hard on myself because I was like, 'Oh, this is how other people perceived me.'</p><p>"I became insecure because of everyone else telling me."</p><p>She ultimately decided to go under the knife, stating: "For me, everyone says, 'Oh my gosh, she's had her third face transplant,' but I've had one <a href=#>nose job.</a>"</p><p>After confirming she's had plastic surgery, Khloe added: "And everyone gets so upset, like, why don't I talk about it. No one's ever asked me."</p><p>She also admitted to trying <a href=#>injections</a>, though said she "responded horribly to Botox."</p><p>Back in April, Fabulous Digital spoke to a cosmetic surgeon who believes the&nbsp;<a href=#>KUWTK</a>&nbsp;star has <a href=#>spent $50,000 on her face</a> to pull off her glamorous new look.</p><h2><strong>KOURTNEY'S BOOB JOB</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kourtney</a>, 42, has also gone under the knife, though she said she regrets it.</p><p>The eldest Kardashian has been open about her past boob job, which she got done in college.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She told <a href=#>Showbiz Spy</a> during a 2011 interview: “I had my boobs done but if I could go back, I wouldn’t have done it. I was so cute before.</p><p>“I’ve realized that I was made to look a certain way and I’m considering removing them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000689652600.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000689652611.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000647979192.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/NINTCHDBPICT000659908468.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Kendall Jenner strips down to thong bikini on yacht with boyfriend Devin Booker</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hraWmFcYOWaKKeppSWua15yZ6lp52iYr2trdKtoJxlo6q%2FqLHRsmSfrZyheqetwp5kppmjoHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chris-moran-rugby-las-vegas-stag-do-yorkshire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brit rugby player Chris Moran is killed on Las Vegas stag do after being run over by lorry as he cro">&larr;
