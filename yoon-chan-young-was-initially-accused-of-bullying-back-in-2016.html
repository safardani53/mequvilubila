The South Korean program just surpassed HBO’s Euphoria as the most popular. Aside from the tight plot, the cast of All of Us Are Dead has pleased both Korean and foreign fans.&nbsp;Yoon Chan-young, who portrays Cheong-san, the loyal and resolute male protagonist, was one of the young performers who received the most accolades. His public image looks to have suffered as a result of recent charges of bullying and sexism during his middle school years.</p><h2>Yoon Chan-young, the star of ‘All of Us Are Dead,’ was first accused of bullying in 2016.</h2><p>The actor made his acting debut ten years ago, but he is most recognized for his role in All of Us Are Dead.&nbsp;In September 2016, an unidentified netizen stated that the actor, together with several of his classmates, had supposedly constructed a list of female students and instructors based on various criteria of beauty and appeal in his last year of middle school.</p><p>The netizen had said in a series of tweets:</p><p>“Last year, I had no idea how terrible our country’s sexism was. They constantly taught us in school that prejudice against women had diminished significantly, and I honestly believed it. I’m not sure whether it was because we were taught this that I was more sensitive to it, but the situation detonated in the midst of this.”</p><p>“Instead of claiming it burst, maybe it would be more accurate to state that children discovered a piece of paper. During lunch, I saw my companions staring at a piece of paper and muttering, and I was curious as to why they were cursing, so I looked as well. The paper was a standard-based ranking of our class’s female pupils”</p><p>“Our female instructor was rated as well. I was one of the top three faces, and I’m not sure how the ladies were rated, but I believe they were based on separate criteria.” Everyone else, save those included in the paper and those who wrote the rating, were advised to go home by our ethics instructor. She demanded that the criminals come out and confront the wall. The perpetrators were Park Joo-hyung, Im Se-hyun, and Hong Ji-pyo. Yes, that is correct. Yoon Chan-young is a child actress.”</p><p>Yoon Chan-young was in his last year of middle school when the claims were made public in 2016. According to the ad, the event occurred in 2015. They also claimed to have gotten an apology over KakaoTalk, however it is unclear if it was from Yoon Chan-young or one of the other parties involved.</p><p dir=ltr lang=und><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/r1ETjg7hTk</a></p><p>— 기록용 계정 (@ensowflahe) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 2, 2016</a></p><p>According to the apologetic message:</p><p>“Because it seems that you will not check KakaoTalk, I am informing you by SMS. I sincerely apologize. I didn’t do it because I didn’t like you but I was just joking with the kids and we might have crossed the line. As the leader, I really regret not stopping them and even doing it with them, and I apologize. I’m not going to do that again. I sincerely apologize. Please give me another opportunity this time.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yoon-Chan-young-3.jpg alt="Yoon Chan-young" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Not long after the popularity of All of Us Are Dead, the 2016 accusations reappeared, with another netizen claiming to be Yoon Chan-classmate young’s verifying the charges, saying:</p><p>“It’s finally come to light. I was a middle school friend of his.”</p><p>The public reaction to the current bullying scandal has been varied. While some think that bringing Yoon Chan-earlier young’s transgressions to light is only fair, many others say that dredging into the past is not useful to anybody, particularly because the event occurred when the All of Us Are Dead actor was just 14 years old and in middle school.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yoon-Chan-young-4.jpg alt="Yoon Chan-young" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The recent rise in the number of fake bullying complaints in the Korean entertainment business has led many to question the reality of Yoon Chan’s claims. young’s Meanwhile, neither Yoon Chan-young nor his agency have issued a remark on the situation.
