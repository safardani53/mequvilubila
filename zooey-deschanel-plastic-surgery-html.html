Zooey Deschanel had plastic surgery and CHANGED her face!”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Interestingly, a few of her fans have shown their support amid the rumor. They opined her plastic surgery was unnoticeable and complimented her surgeon.</p><p>One particular user wrote, “How did I not know Zooey Deschanel had plastic surgery?”</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, others have stated she was losing her original self because of the cosmetic procedures.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>One user even claimed, “the plastic surgery Zooey Deschanel had done makes her look like a Madame Tussaud’s figure of herself.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While the 500 Days of Summer star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">might have some work done on her face privately, she hasn’t addressed the rumors yet</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Instead, she has been vocal about using makeup since a young age.&nbsp;</p><p>In a 2021&nbsp;interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Byrdie</a>, Deschanel said&nbsp;she’s been doing makeup for a long time and knew her way around it since she was 8 or 9. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I learned how to shade and highlight and contour, but there wasn’t any practical makeup—we never used eyeliner!” added the star.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Deschanel has never spoken about any plastic surgery rumors regarding her. Hence, it won’t be fair just to label that she could have gone under the knife. It might also be a case that she has never had plastic surgery but has been maintaining sharp looks through diet, lifestyle, and other choices, similar to actress <a href=# rel=follow>Alicia Silverstone</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Deschanel’s bangs-less photo spurred memes and more plastic&nbsp; surgery rumors</h2><p>New Girl star Zooey Deschanel, who has an estimated net worth of $25 million,&nbsp;usually opts for a hairstyle with fringe.

I love that we talk things through, even when we don’t see eye to eye,” He continued. “I love it when you make me laugh, and it happens quite a lot.”</p><p>On the other hand, Deschanel, who has named Scott “the best boyfriend,” shared heartfelt photos of the pair on the occasion of the 2023 Valentine’s day.
