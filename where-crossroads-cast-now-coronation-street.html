peak - ratings Corrie and Emmerdale could only dream of these days - the ITV show entertained fans for 22 years until 1988.</p><img

the Crossroads Motel finally shut its doors in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>It introduced audiences to a plethora of iconic stars including <a href=#>Noele Gordon</a>, who played the role of <a href=#>motel boss Meg Mortimer</a>.</p><p>Noele won TV Times’ most popular actress on eight occasions.&nbsp;</p><p>Tonight a new <a href=#>ITVX</a> series, Nolly, brings <a href=#>her story</a> to life - with her&nbsp;brutal sacking from the soap by resentful male bosses in 1981 pivotal to the plot.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="MORE ON TV">MORE ON TV</h2><p>Noele, who died from cancer aged 65 in 1985, is <a href=#>played</a> by Hollywood superstar <a href=#>Helena Bonham Carter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of its premiere, we take a look at what happened to the rest of the Crossroads cast.</p><h2>Jane Rossington&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/newspress-collage-21251301-1675353424986.jpg><p>Starring as Jill Richardson, Jane, now 77,&nbsp;was the only original cast member to appear in the first and last episode.</p><p>She spoke the first words on the show when it first aired on November 2, 1964.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Soaps</h2></p><p>Jane's storylines ranged from marriage breakdowns to booze addiction and even having a baby with her stepbrother.</p><p>Due to not having a permanent contact on the show, she also starred in other shows including BBC Radio 4’s The Archers.&nbsp;</p><p>She returned to Crossroads in 2000 for its revival after shying away from TV work to focus on stage shows.&nbsp;</p><p>Jane now lives in Staffordshire with her second husband David Dunger, who revealed last year that she is sadly suffering from <a href=#>Alzheimer’s disease</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Albert Shepherd</h2><img

children.</p><p>Just three weeks after being diagnosed with lung cancer, he died from the disease at a York hospital in July 2019 aged 82.</p><h2>Sue Nicholls&nbsp;</h2><img

href=#>Coronation Street</a> but <a href=#>Sue Nicholls</a> had a leading role in Crossroads for four years.&nbsp;</p><p>The 79-year-old played Marilyn Gates and even managed to reach number 17 in the UK singles charts with a song she first sang on the show called Where Will You Be?</p><p>After the show Sue tried to keep her pop star momentum going but ended up as a stage actress instead.&nbsp;</p><p>She landed the role of no-nonsense Audrey on Corrie in 1979 and still plays her now.&nbsp;In 2019, she received the prestigious Outstanding Achievement prize at the <a href=#>British&nbsp;Soap Awards</a>.</p><p>In 2011, a nurse noticed a mole on Sue’s shoulder and immediately contacted show bosses to express her concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>It was later diagnosed as <a href=#>malignant melanoma</a> and removed, with the nurse being invited on set so Sue could thank her.&nbsp;</p><p>Sue was married to fellow Corrie actor Mark Eden from 1993 until his death from Alzheimer's disease in January 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kathy Staff&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

TV history, from 1978 until its first run ended in 1988.&nbsp;</p><p>He was one of a handful of stars to return for the show’s revival in 2001 but his character was killed off in a fire.&nbsp;</p><p>He later revealed that a crazed fan tried to stab him with a knife but was intercepted by two security guards standing nearby.</p><p>Although he is best known for played Adam, he also appeared in a stage adaptation of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in late 2004.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013 it was revealed that Tony suffers from osteoarthritis, which he believes was a result of eating an
