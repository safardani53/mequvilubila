What Happened To Sarah On ‘The Bachelor’?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sarah was on season 26 of&nbsp;The Bachelor with&nbsp;<strong>Clayton Echard</strong>. The two formed a fast connection, and Clayton gave Sarah a group date rose during week two. She then had a one-on-one with Clayton during week three, where their connection intensified and she got another rose. During week six, Sarah got another one-on-one date. At that point, though, Clayton began questioning whether she was ready for the commitment that he was hoping for after the show. Another contestant,&nbsp;<strong>Mara Agrait</strong>, got in Clayton’s head with claims that Sarah wasn’t on the show for the right reasons, and Clayton started fearing that Sarah’s young age would be an issue for them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>On the date, Sarah got emotional and began crying, which eventually led to Clayton apologizing to her. He wound up giving her the one-on-one date rose and then <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eliminating Mara</a> at the rose ceremony. However, Sarah wound up getting eliminated on the next group date during week 7, just one episode before hometowns.</p><h2>2. What Does Sarah Do?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Sarah, who is just 24 years old, works as a wealth management advisor in New York City. She has been employed by SmartAsset, a financial technology company, since the beginning of 2022, according to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LinkedIn</a>. Before that, Sarah worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. She started in Jan. 2020 in the Financial Advisor Development Program, and worked as a Financial Analyst and Fraud Analyst for the Payment Protection Program until mid 2021. Prior to that, she served as an intern at Tapestry, the parent company of various fashion brands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sarah-hamrick-5-things-to-know-abc-embed1-1.jpg><h2>3. Where Did Sarah Go To College?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Sarah attended Clemson University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Marketing in 2019. She minored in communication and graduated Magna Cum Laude. At school, she was in various honor societies and named a Leadership Scholar for the Business School.</p><h2>4. Sarah Competed In Pageants</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Sarah was the winner of Miss South Carolina Teen 2015. She then went on to compete in Miss America’s Outstanding Teen pageant in 2016, where she placed in the top 10. At the Outstanding Teen competition, she also won the preliminary award for Evening Wear & On-Stage Question.</p><h2>5. Sarah Was Adopted</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>During her time on&nbsp;The Bachelor, Sarah opened up to Clayton about being adopted. She revealed that she is Vietnamese and was adopted by a white family. “Sometimes growing up I would feel ashamed I was adopted,” Sarah admitted. “My adopted parents love me and have given me the world. It’s how I made decisions and shapes what I want in love and relationships and family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Sarah created a non-profit organization that aims to support other adopted adopted children. Growing the charity is one of her hobbies. However, she is no stranger to charity work. Sarah served as a volunteer and ambassador for the Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals from 2013 until 2020, as well. The organization “raises funds for children’s hospitals, medical research and community awareness of children’s health issues,” according to LinkedIn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2LAor7AoWShmZ2ntqS3jK2fnmWSlrCpscuoqWZsZmeFdIOUaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./friends-guests-stars-pay-tribute-to-matthew-perry-8384280.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Friends' Guest Stars Pay Tribute to Matthew Perry">&larr;
