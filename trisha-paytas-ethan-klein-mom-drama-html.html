They have been on the internet for 15 years and have fought with many&nbsp;people, especially the YouTube community,&nbsp;including Jeffree Star, Shane Dawson, <a href=# rel=follow>David Dobrik, Jeff Witteck</a>, Nikita Dragun, Jason Nash, and many more. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Usually,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Paytas</a> uses Twitter and YouTube to expose their nemesis.&nbsp;However, when they call out other people, the audience cannot help but question their hypocrisy and actions.</p><p>But this has not stopped them from creating more drama.&nbsp;Recently, Paytas attended Daniel Keem aka Keemstar and Faze Bank's podcast Mom's Basement. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Keemstar has a long-standing feud with fellow YouTuber and podcast host Ethan Klein.&nbsp;Since Ethan and Paytas have a rivalry of their own, he called them out for attending his enemy's&nbsp;podcast.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Paytas retaliated and accused Ethan and his&nbsp;mom, Donna Klein, of trying to ruin their relationship.&nbsp;The situation is kind of messy, so let us start from the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The History of Paytas-Klein Feud</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Paytas used to have a lengthy feud with Ethan.&nbsp;Paytas' spat with Ethan dates back to May 2019, when Ethan&nbsp;mocked Paytas' looks and chastised them for how much they alter&nbsp;their photographs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On February and March 2020, Paytas came to the H3 Podcast,&nbsp;hosted by Ethan and his wife, Hila Klein. But then, they quashed their long-standing beef and seemed to be on good terms.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After the first podcast in February, the Kleins planned to create a Bachelorette-style program to help Paytas find a boyfriend. They picked some of their&nbsp;favorite competitors by assessing their video clips.</p><p>Then, during&nbsp;the second show on March 14, 2020, they showed an interest in Hila's brother, Moses Hacmon. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Paytas was not supposed to text contestants while the Kleins were looking for a partner for them.&nbsp;At the end of March 2020, the contest was placed on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Paytas began breaching the show's rules by starting a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relationship with&nbsp;Hacmon</a> behind the Kleins' backs. Ethan and Hila did not know what was going on since Hacmon was avoiding his family.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>At first, they were unsupportive of the relationship but slowly&nbsp;accepted Paytas in their family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>From Enemies to Friends to Enemies</h2><p>Once again, to quash their beef, Ethan and Paytas took the help of the podcast. But this time, they launched a podcast on September 15, 2020, called Frenemies under Ethan's company H3H3 Productions.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They sorted out their differences on the podcast, and Ethan helped bring Paytas into a new light. Their viewers started appreciating Frenemies and started accepting the unapologetic Paytas.&nbsp;</p><p>The pair also shed light on problematic YouTubers like the Vlog Squad and <a href=# rel=follow>Gabbie Hanna</a>. Similarly, when Paytas was engaged to Hacmon on December 25, 2020, Ethan accepted them as his sister-in-law. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>However, there was still a little tension between the two.&nbsp;Paytas had several meltdowns on the podcast and claimed to quit the show on December 2020. However, they apologized and moved forward.</p><p>But it did not last long. On June 8, 2020, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Paytas quit Frenemies</a> over monetary and ownership disputes. Unfortunately, things took a worse turn when Paytas took everything to social media.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>They tweeted horrible things about the Kleins and exposed the private messages and conversations. Since then, the Kleins have shown their disappointment and stayed away from them.&nbsp;</p><h2>Donna and Ethan v. Paytas and Keemstar</h2><p>After Paytas parted ways with Frenemies, Ethan revamped the podcast and named it Families. He invited his mom Donna as his co-host, and the fans have been loving the mother-son duo more than the dynamic between Paytas and Ethan.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Since the first episode of Families, Donna has shown her dislike towards Paytas. Recently, she has been very vocal about it on Twitter after Paytas went to Mom's Basement.&nbsp;</p><p>On August 15, 2021, Keemstar took to Twitter to upload a picture of himself flipping&nbsp;the camera off with Paytas and Banks on his left.&nbsp;Ethan shared he was disappointed&nbsp;at how his ex-friend and future sister-in-law went to his enemy's podcast.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Donna chimed in and called Paytas a "weasel." Additionally, she also confirmed that she would not be attending Paytas and Hacmon's wedding.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Paytas and Keemstar also have a long-standing rivalry. They justified their decision to go on the show, stating that they "go on podcasts to try to find peace with people."</p><p>They also added that they have called out Keemstar and defended Ethan on the upcoming episode of Mom's Basement. However, Paytas was extremely upset with Donna's response.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>As a result, they penned a series of tweets, calling out Donna for trying to ruin their relationship with Hacmon. They called Donna "Satan" and claimed she texted Hacmon "disgusting things" after their fight.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Paytas also claimed to be the bigger person trying to solve the drama in private but blamed Kleins for making it public. Similarly,&nbsp;Hacmon said that his brother-in-law "didn't even listen" to Paytas' appearance on Mom's Basement.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p>Neither Ethan nor Donna directly responded to her, but this is not the end of the feud.</p><p>Looking at history, the Kleins will surely react to Paytas on their podcasts.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Similarly, there is a maximum probability that Paytas will retaliate back on YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter.</p><p>So, all that is left to do is wait and watch.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyinsCprYypmLKskah6psDHmqVmo5yatq95zKikZpyilrqiesetpKU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jessica-van-der-steen-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jessica Van Der Steen Dating Now">&larr;
