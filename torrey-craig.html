And yet, there he was, attempting to stop a big kid on a fish and shark fast-break drill.</p><p>Braylon, to be honest, is unconcerned about the experience. He’s been all over the world. He’s already seen more of the planet than most of us will. To him, the world is a blue-and-brown basketball.</p><p>Former Marquette star <a href=# rel=noopener>Dwyane Wade</a> is his favorite player.

It’s simple because his mother deserves the majority of the credit.&nbsp;</p><h2>Torrey Craig Controversy: Cheated on His Ex-Girlfriend&nbsp;</h2><p>Torrey Craig dated Nicole Zavala for a few years. She is a Colombian model who has a massive fan following on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>The NBA player who was in a long-term relationship with Nicole Zavala from the VH1 hit series Cartel Crew cheated on her.</p><p>The couple appeared to be very serious about their relationship, as they had also discussed starting a family together for quite some time.</p><p>However, Nicole discovered over the weekend that Torrey had been sleeping with another reality star, Winter Blanco of Bad Girls Club.</p><p>And it was allegedly Winter who inadvertently revealed that she is Torrey’s sidekick. In Torrey’s bedroom, Winter leaked a picture of herself in lingerie.
