I drank up every word he said. I was begging him to take me with him.”</p><p>Thrilled, Yossi then convinced two new friends he had met just days before — Swiss explorer Marcus Stamm and American photographer Kevin Gale — to join the expedition.</p><p>The four men flew to a starting point in the rainforest north of La Paz then set off into the jungle on foot.</p><p>Tensions soon began to emerge.</p><p>Marcus developed trench foot and struggled to keep up with the group.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000358164422.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000358164430.jpg><p>They were also fast running out of their meagre supply of rice and beans. Yossi said: “We were very hungry, walking long days and eating hardly anything.</p><p>“We shot and ate monkeys. Of course I wouldn’t have killed ­someone and eaten them but I can understand how people eat human flesh in that situation.</p><p>“I would have eaten anything. I would have eaten human flesh.</p><p>“When you reach that level of hunger, nothing is disgusting, nothing is appalling.”</p><p>Two weeks into the trip, they were no closer to finding the tribe or the gold. The group decided to split up.</p><p>Yossi and photographer Kevin would build a makeshift raft and continue the trip on the Tuichi River, while they persuaded Marcus to head back to civilisation with Karl on foot.</p><p>But once they set off on their raft, Yossi and his friend only got deeper into trouble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000358638495.jpg><p>Yossi, whose best-selling book about his experience has been adapted into the movie Jungle, out next week, said: “We lost control of the raft in the current and were smashed against a rock.”</p><p>Kevin made it to shore, but the Israeli was left clinging to the remnants of the raft as the waters raced him towards a waterfall with a sheer drop.</p><p>He said: “I was dragged along by the force of the water for half an hour.</p><p>“I struggled to keep my head above water as I smashed into rocks and fallen trees. The level of pain is beyond my ability to describe.”</p><p>But he managed to struggle to the riverbank where, all alone and without his luggage, he suddenly realised a quick death over the falls might have been his best option.</p><p>He recalled: “I thought I would have a long, miserable and violent death.”</p><p>But when his backpack was washed ashore, it gave him hope.</p><p>He said: “When I’d been drafted to the army, my uncle had given me a book and it was in the backpack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000358164433.jpg><p>He’d been through the Holocaust and told me the book had ­protected him — it was a religious book with no title.</p><p>“I didn’t believe in it. I thought he was going to give me a folding knife and I couldn’t hide my disappointment. But on the river I burst into tears when I found it. I thought, ‘I’m not going to die.’”</p><p>There were times over the next weeks that he began to doubt that, however. He faced attacks from wild boar, the constant threat of poisonous snakes, endless termite bites — and, on his sixth night alone in the jungle, that hungry jaguar.</p><p>Yossi had been asleep when he was awoken by rustling, and woke up face-to-face with the big cat.</p><p>Its eyes were locked on him and it was about to move in for the kill.</p><p>With no weapon, he grabbed the only things he had to hand — a can of mosquito repellent and a lighter — and improvised the flame-thrower.</p><p>Yossi said: “I learnt the trick from a James Bond movie.”</p><p>But the worst experience of all as he hiked day after day in what he hoped was the direction of the ­nearest settlement was the flesh and skin tearing from his feet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000358164456.jpg><p>They became so infected that soon he had no skin left. He said: “They were just chunks of exposed flesh. I couldn’t take the pain.</p><p>“I dragged myself to a tree full of fire ants and shook it on my head. The waves of pain and adrenaline distracted me from my feet.”</p><p>On the 17th day, a plane flew overhead but did not see him.</p><p>He recalled: “When the plane passed it just broke me, that surge of hope was the worst thing that happened to me.”</p><p>Yossi was sobbing in the mud when, to his amazement, he looked up and seemed to see a girl.</p><p>He said: “She appeared in the worst moment when I really gave up. I talked to her all the time but she didn’t talk back. I built a camp for us both and made a space for her to sleep next to me.” But then one night the girl vanished into thin air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict0003581643991.jpg><p>Yossi explained: “I was trying to hug her and I realised there was nobody there. I freaked out because if she’s not there it means I’m crazy.</p><p>“I thought I’d lost my sanity. I was very scared. I don’t know exactly how to explain it. Maybe my subconscious pulled it out?”</p><p>But he believes the “girl” saved his life — because she needed him.</p><p>He said: “That’s something very deep about human nature. We’ll do more to save someone else’s life than our own because I couldn’t help myself any more. I felt it was over.</p><p>“But the moment she was there, suddenly I had responsibility.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000358164385.jpg><p>On top of everything else, Yossi also nearly drowned — twice — after the worst storm in a decade hit the area. He said: “The second swamp I fell in, I couldn’t pull myself out. I was thinking of committing suicide, but then I thought that if I was going to kill myself I should have done it in the first couple of days.</p><p>“After 19 days of struggle, there was no way I was dying then.”</p><p>Yossi was rescued the next day.</p><p>Kevin, the American photographer he had been separated from during the rafting debacle, had managed to make his way to a settlement.</p><p>There he got a local man with a boat to take him out to look for his friend. After a long and fruitless hunt Kevin and the man had just given up and were turning back when Yossi spotted their boat on the river.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000359814581.jpg><p>He said: “I tried to run and scream but found myself frozen and speechless.</p><p>“It was a miracle that Kevin looked back and saw me.” Yossi had lost more than two and a half stone and was “skin hanging on bones”. Locals still see his survival as a miracle.</p><p>He explained: “They say they wouldn’t have been able to make it.”</p><p>Marcus and Karl never came back from the expedition and no trace of them has ever been found.</p><p>Yossi later learned that Karl, played by Thomas Kretschmann in <a href=#>the film,</a> was actually a wanted criminal.</p><p>He said: “He was no geologist and there was no tribe or gold.”</p><p>Now a tech entrepreneur and ­motivational speaker living in ­Australia with third wife Belinda and their three children, Yossi still spends a lot of time travelling.</p><p>He said: “It seems to be the story of my life.</p><p>“I’m more experienced and responsible now but no less naive and keen to live my life as a great adventure.”</p><p>Jungle is in cinemas on October 20</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FILM</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhsZmyAc4OQaKGuppehsm6yyKWkZqyiqrJuv9OoqbJllJa7qrHLZqmanJOhtqeyxKxkp52nYrqwwsieZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kyle-smaine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kyle Smaine- Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Wife">&larr;
