the deals, the <a href=#>Home Office</a> pays firms such as contractor Serco up to £150million a year to find accommodation for asylum seekers.</p><img

Braverman </a>has vowed to stop<a href=#> small boats </a>crossing the Channel by introducing a new <a href=#>Illegal Immigration Bill </a>that will ensure that people who arrive here ­without permission will be “detained and swiftly removed”.</p><p>The proposal caused an outcry last week with<a href=#> Match Of The Day </a>host <a href=#>Gary Lineker </a>comparing the ­Government’s language to that of<a href=#> pre-war Nazi Germany.</a></p><p>But critics say the current hotel policy is having a dramatic impact on the areas where the migrants are housed, and fails to take into account the needs of local communities.</p><p>There have been numerous complaints of room bookings being cancelled at short notice after hotels were handed Government contracts, leaving <a href=#>weddings</a>, parties and long-planned functions in disarray.</p><p>Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, Northants, said: “We must stop this horrendous waste of money and get these economic migrants out of hotels and into camps or ships.</p><p>“It’s right the Government is working to solve this problem by stopping them from crossing the Channel, and sending them back home or to <a href=#>Rwanda </a>if they do get here.</p><p>“This is the number one issue for my constituents.”</p><p>In fact Mr Bone’s call to move migrants out of hotels could be answered by the end of the week.</p><p>Military families have been asked to move out of a base near Braintree, <a href=#>Essex</a>, in preparation for incoming asylum seekers.</p><p>Plans are also being drawn up to house some on cruise ships and ferries, but that is “some way off” according to sources.</p><p>Meanwhile, of the Britannia Group’s 10,000 hotel rooms nationwide, 2,619 — more than a quarter — are accommodating asylum seekers.</p><p>According to Home Office figures, the cost of hotel accommodation for the migrants who make it across the Channel is £6million a day — an average of £117.64 per migrant.</p><p>But details of the individual contracts with hotel bosses are hidden, with <a href=#>Whitehall </a>officials insisting they fall under commercial confidentiality so cannot be disclosed.</p><p>Conservative MP for Blackpool South Scott Benton told The Sun on Sunday: “I’ve asked ministers a great deal of questions about how much these hotels cost and so on and, to be honest, I’ve hit a brick wall.</p><p>"The Government is clearly embarrassed about the cost to taxpayers when people can’t gain access to basic public services like a GP.”</p><p>The number of migrant hotels has nearly doubled to 400 in just five months as the Home Office struggles to cope with a record number of arrivals and claims.</p><p>In 2022, 45,755 <a href=#>asylum seekers reached the English coast</a> after crossing the Channel, 60 per cent up on the previous year.</p><p>Other hotel chains housing migrants in Britain include Novotel, Mercure and Holiday Inn.</p><p>Home Office data shows contractors such as Serco and Clearsprings have taken over 363 hotels in England, 20 in <a href=#>Northern Ireland</a>, ten in <a href=#>Scotland </a>and two in <a href=#>Wales</a>.</p><p>Serco is being paid £1.9billion over ten years to find accommodation, and another firm, Mears, has a ten-year deal reportedly worth £1billion.</p><p>Serco, which is providing 109 hotels in England, saw its ­revenues surge £109million to £4.53billion in 2022.</p><p>Its annual report from that year referenced “growth” in its immigration work.</p><p>Mears Group, which is running 80 hotels, saw its annual revenue rise by 22 per cent in 2021.</p><p>And we can reveal that Clearsprings boss Graham King, 55, received a £47million windfall from the sale of shares in the firm.</p><p>The Cheshire-based Britannia group runs more than 60 hotels.</p><h2>‘Dignity and humanity’</h2><p>Its chief ­executive Alex Langsam entered the Sunday Times Rich List in 2016 with an estimated fortune of £220million.</p><p>Langsam, 84, lives in a £3.4million mansion and earned the nickname “Asylum King” after allowing his firm’s historic English and Scottish hotels — most run on the cheap — to be used as makeshift accommodation for the Home Office since 2014.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Britannia repeatedly ranked bottom of Which? magazine’s annual survey of hotel chains.</p><p>Many of the company’s hotels are now booked out indefinitely by Home Office contractors.</p><p>They include the Ashley, in Hale, Gtr <a href=#>Manchester</a>, an affluent village where several Premier League footballers live, and the North Stafford Hotel, a Grade II listed Jacobean building in<a href=#> Stoke-on-Trent</a>, and the Britannia Nottingham, a five-minute walk from Nottingham Castle.</p><p>One of Britannia’s two London hotels is near Hampstead village and the celebrity crowd in Primrose Hill.</p><p>Its hotels in Wolverhampton, Wigan, Stockport, Birmingham, Manchester, Gatwick and Horley, Surrey have also been booked out.</p><p>The Clifton was once one of<a href=#> Scarborough</a>’s more prestigious hotels, but is now surrounded by security guards paid by a Government ­contractor, say locals.</p><p>The Daresbury Park Hotel in Warrington has been ­comman- deered, as has the Royal Hotel in Hull, a Grade II listed building.</p><p>Two more — the Roundhouse and the Britannia — are in the seaside resort of Bournemouth.</p><p>Politicians there have also warned that using hotels could damage the tourism industry and have called on ministers to treat refugees with “the dignity and humanity they deserve” by finding proper housing.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Metropole sits on what was once a prime spot at the northern end of Blackpool’s promenade.</p><p>But with visitor numbers to the Lancs resort plunging from 17million a year to 10million since the 1990s, it is now located in one of the poorest wards in England.</p><p>There are currently 350 migrants at the Metropole and the ones we spoke to said they felt in limbo, having been there almost a year.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Paul Maynard, MP for Blackpool North and Cleveleys, said: “I’ve always made the point to ministers that it is simply not the right place to house migrants.</p><p>“To put vulnerable people arriving in this country in the middle of so much social deprivation is not in their ­interest, nor the town’s.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
