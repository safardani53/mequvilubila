He was inducted into the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame in 1968.</p><p>Also, <strong>Mosconi Cup,</strong> an annual nine-ball tournament, has been held every year since 1994 between teams representing Europe and the United States in his honor.</p><h2>Willie Mosconi<strong> |</strong>&nbsp;Education</h2><p>On June 27, 1913, Willie Mosconi was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He grew up alongside five siblings.</p><p>Willie’s father, Joseph Mosconi, was a former boxer and poolroom owner, while his mother, Helen O’Reilly, was a housewife.</p><p>Willie attended South Philadelphia High School before his father enrolled him in Banks Business College.</p><h2>Willie Mosconi | Career As A Pool Player</h2><h3>How did he start playing pool?</h3><p>Willie Mosconi was a child prodigy who started showing his skills when he was young. His father had a pool room in his home, and maybe that’s what inspired him to become a pool player. But, Willie was born to be a pool player.</p><p>However, His father, Joseph, wanted Willie to pursue a career as a Vaudeville entertainer like his uncles. So, he used to hide the stick and ball from William.</p><p>But, Willie was so interested and passionate about billiards that he started playing billiards with broomsticks and potatoes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Willie-Mosconi-in-a-tournament.jpg><p>Seeing William’s talent and passion for billiards, his father changed his mind and let him play billiards. However, Joseph wanted him to become a great billiard player.</p><p>Henceforth, Joseph Mosconi arranged challenge matches for his kid to learn more and grow. Willie beat experienced players in those arranged matches and slowly earned his name at a young age.</p><p>In 1919, Mosconi, who was only six years old, competed in an exhibition match against Ralph Greenleaf, the reigning World Champion.</p><p>The hall was packed, and Mosconi played well enough to earn a tie despite Greenleaf’s victory. This event led him to pursue a professional career.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>You may also like reading on 13 Hot Pool Players to Look for This Year>></a></strong></p><h3>Professional Career</h3><p>In 1924, Mosconi was already the junior straight pool champion at 11. In the early 1930s, Mosconi took a break from the game to focus on his studies.</p><p>After the short break, Mosconi’s career elevated to the next level as he entered one local event after another, winning all of them. Finally, after a short time, he started making a living as a professional pool player.</p><p>In 1933, Mosconi competed in the World Straight Pool Championship of the Billiard Congress of America (BCA). He came close to winning the title, but Erwin Rudolph beat him in the final.</p><p>His performance drew the attention of Brunswick Corporation’s president, who employed him on the spot. After that, Mosconi began a frantic cross-country exhibition the same year.</p><p>He started to compete in pool tournaments, and with lots of failures, Willie finally won his first world pool championship in 1941.</p><p>Later, Wille was sponsored by Billiard halls and supported by McGirr’s, a New York City nightclub for the tournament series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/willie-mosconi-1.jpg><p>He dominated this series, running 125 balls from the break five times, a feat accomplished by only two other players in history.&nbsp;</p><h3>United States Army</h3><p>But, his professional career was halted as he enrolled in the United States Army in 1944. Yes, you read it right, he took part in World War II and was in the department of defense in industry.</p><p>However, Willie did not reside there long and resumed his pool career. In 1957, he made a fantastic comeback by winning the BCA World Championship for the second time.</p><h3>Conflict with <a href=#>Rudolf Wanderone</a></h3><p>Moreover, World Champion Mosconi was in the limelight due to a feud between him and&nbsp;<span data-preserver-spaces=true>Rudolf “Minnesota Fats” Wanderone till the 80s. The discussion was over how to present pool either as a scuffled gambling game or a mastery game.</span></p><p>Mosconi’s first wife, Flora, said of conflict, “My husband hated Minnesota Fats because he felt that [Wanderone] was always hurting the image of the game instead of helping it.”</p><p>Also, the two competed on February 25, 1978, in “The Great Pool Shoot-Out,” a US$15,000 televised match on ABC’s <i>Wide World of Sports.</i></p><p>As a result, Mosconi won all three sets of the match, which included nine-ball, eight-ball, and rotation, 5–2, 5–3, and 5–2 sequentially.</p><p>Mosconi officially retired as a professional pool player in 1966 at the age of 53, although he remained engaged in the game’s promotion. Also, he worked as a consultant and appeared in several films.</p><h2>Willie Mosconi | Books</h2><p>The billiard legend wrote the famous book Willie Mosconi on Pocket Billiards. It is a pocket billiards instructional book he co-authored with a ghostwriter.</p><p>The book provides fundamental instruction, images, and diagrams on shotmaking and straight pool methods.
