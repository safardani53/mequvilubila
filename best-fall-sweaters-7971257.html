We can assist with the latter, being recently inspired by the fall sweater trends that celebrities like Reese Witherspoon, Meghan Markle, and Gigi Hadid have been spotted wearing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“A great sweater should captivate you,” celebrity stylist Cindy Conroy tells PEOPLE. “The perfect fall sweater will reveal itself when you consider three things: warmth, comfort, and style.” She also looks at “the cut, color, coziness, and proportions.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to physical attributes, you should also consider the overall value. “It’s important for your purchases to be valuable, durable, and timeless,” fashion stylist and personal shopper Elisabeth Kassab tells PEOPLE. “I look for a cozy material and shape in a good sweater.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re in the market for a cool cardigan, a cozy turtleneck, a sleek ribbed sweater, or a classic cable knit, there’s a fall sweater style for every wardrobe preference. We scouted the best fall sweaters from popular brands like Amazon, Mango, Lulus, and more — all for under $100.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the best fall sweaters to kick off your seasonal style.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-top-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Top Picks</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Qualfort Women’s Cardigan</a>, $39.99; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Mango Decorative Seams Cardigan</a>, $59.99; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">mango.com</a></li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lulus Winter Love Color Block Cardigan Sweater</a>, $59; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">lulus.com</a></li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=7 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lulus Chic Observations Ribbed Turtleneck Sweater Top</a>, $46; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=8 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">lulus.com</a></li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=9 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Eloquii Boxy Three Quarter Sleeve Turtleneck</a>, $38.97 (orig. $64.95); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=10 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">eloquii.com</a></li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=11 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Maeve Ribbed Turtleneck</a>, $48; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=12 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">anthropologie.com</a></li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=13 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Treasure & Bond One-Shoulder Rib Sweater</a>, $69; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=14 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">nordstrom.com</a></li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=15 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cider Striped Knit Round Neckline Long Sleeve Top</a>, $24, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=16 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">shopcider.com</a></li><li><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=17 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon Essentials Fisherman Cable Crewneck Sweater</a>, $35.60; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=18 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></li><li><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=19 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Zesica Crew Neck Ribbed Sweater</a>, $39.99; <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=20 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a><br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cardigan-sweaters></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cardigan Sweaters</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Reese Witherspoon / Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We wouldn’t blame you if your love for cardigans started with the Taylor Swift song of the same name. Or perhaps you appreciate the sporty style of cardigans, which have long been paired with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tennis skirts</a> and other club apparel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No matter the origins of your interest, the cardigan “remains a time honored autumn favorite,” says Conroy. “Worn open or closed, cardigans are a versatile piece […and the] perfect addition to any style repertoire. You can dress them up or down and wear them for various occasions.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reese Witherspoon is one of many fans of this trend, opting for a chunky, winter green version in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>a recent Instagram</a> the actress posted from The Morning Show set. Jennifer Garner has also been spotted rocking a more fitted version of this silhouette, with bold stripes and vibrant gold buttons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you go for a more oversized, bulky cardigan, and pair it with jeans, it takes on a more casual appearance. Conversely, a thinner, more fitted cardigan can be easily dressed up with a skirt or even worn over a dress. <strong>“</strong>Cardigans are amazing because you can layer [them] underneath and over, in so many different ways,” says Kassab. “No two people will style one cardigan the same way.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Get the Look:</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-qualfort-cardigan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Qualfort Cardigan</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With over 5,000 ratings on Amazon, this cardigan is a great look-a-like to the one Witherspoon wore on set. It has the same loose silhouette and woven design, and is available in a huge assortment of colors ranging from neutral beige to Barbie pink. It’s a bit oversized by design, so if you prefer something more fitted, we recommend sizing down.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton | <strong>Sizes: </strong>S–3XL | <strong>Fit: </strong>Relaxed, open front<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>29 | <strong>Cleaning: </strong>Hand wash or machine wash, hang or line dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mango-decorative-seams-cardigan></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mango Decorative Seams Cardigan&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mango</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This ultra soft sweater is available in two neutral shades of gray and beige, making it the perfect base piece to add to your fall closet. Its timeless design makes it versatile for pairing with jeans, long skirts, or work slacks, as the cardigan silhouette blends in with an assortment of styles. The Mango cardigan is made with a blend of viscose and polyester which achieves that almost cashmere-like softness. As a result, it’s a little more delicate than other sweaters on our list, and should only be hand-washed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Viscose, polyester, polyamide | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XXS–4XL |<strong> Fit: </strong>More fitted, button closure | <strong>Colors:</strong> Pastel Gray, Heather Gray | <strong>Cleaning:</strong> Hand wash cold, hang dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lulus-winter-love-color-block-cardigan-sweater></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lulus Winter Love Color Block Cardigan Sweater</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lulus&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not afraid of a little color, this bold color-block cardigan from Lulu’s is just the ticket. The placement of three sturdy buttons creates a secure but playful v-neck silhouette. The materials with this sweater (like many) are ultra soft and as such, a bit finicky with washing —&nbsp;so you’ll need to hand wash the sweater in cold water on laundry day. That said, the stylish design of the cardigan is worth a little effort. It would make the best fall ensemble with a black leather skirt and booties.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, recycled polyester, nylon | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS–XL |<strong> Fit: </strong>More fitted, button closure | <strong>Colors:</strong> Brown and black pattern | <strong>Cleaning:</strong> Hand wash cold, hang dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-free-people-lila-cardi></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Free People Lila Cardi</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want a more relaxed style cardigan, the Lila Cardi from Free People has a cropped, waffle design that would pair just as well with a skirt and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fall boots</a> as with sweatpants and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>comfortable sneakers</a>. It has a good density to it, which would provide some warmth as the days grow chillier, and the soft cotton material is comfortable enough to wear all day. Like others, this one requires careful washing, but with proper care will last for a long time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Editor’s Note: Most sweaters will have hand wash instructions out of caution, but with materials like cotton and polyester, you can also wash the clothing on a delicate cycle with cold water (coming from someone who owns approximately 50 sweaters and can’t be bothered to hand wash anything). That said, never put sweaters in the dryer: They will shrink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Acrylic, cotton | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS–XL |<strong> Fit: </strong>Relaxed, button closer | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Cleaning:</strong> Hand wash cold, hang dry<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-turtleneck-sweaters></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Turtleneck Sweaters</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Samir Hussein/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Turtleneck sweaters</a> are maybe one of the most quintessential styles of fall. Whether chunky or tight enough to tuck into jeans, they are perhaps the coziest type of fall sweater. Fitted options can go well with your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>favorite blazer</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>slacks for work</a>, and the more oversized varieties are perfect for an afternoon of lounging or running errands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Turtlenecks are the perfect mix of sexy and sophisticated,” says Kassab. “I love a fitted turtleneck and an oversized one.” The brown turtleneck from Massimo Dutti that Meghan Markle wore for a public appearance in 2020 is a great example of this sophisticated style.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“For those going for a modest but sultry look, turtlenecks are the perfect go-to,” explains Conroy. “They’re understated, [and] often overlooked, but such a critical base for a number of outfits.” When it’s all said and done, turtlenecks are truly timeless which makes them a trend that you’re going to see again and again.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Get the Look:</span></h3><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lulus-chic-observations-ribbed-turtleneck-sweater-top></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lulus Chic Observations Ribbed Turtleneck Sweater Top</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lulus</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As turtlenecks go, this ribbed variety is a little more fitted, creating the perfect opportunity for a nice tuck. Our advice: Tuck it into a silky midi skirt à la Meghan Markle for a seamless fall look. It’s made with a blend of rayon and polyester, and is ultra soft to wear throughout the day. It’s a true turtleneck style with the neck material reaching up to your chin, so if you opt for the lightest of the three shades available, we’d suggest caution with makeup application.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Rayon, polyester | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS–XL |<strong> Fit: </strong>Fitted, pullover | <strong>Colors:</strong> Black, brown, ivory | <strong>Cleaning:</strong> Hand wash cold, hang dry</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-eloquii-boxy-three-quarter-sleeve-turtleneck></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Eloquii Boxy Three-Quarter Sleeve Turtleneck</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eloquii</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This turtleneck sweater features playful details like flared sleeves and thicker material around the neck. Available in sleek cream and black shades, the silhouette sits right at the hip and has a somewhat relaxed fit. The sophisticated look would wear well with some denim such as a long jean skirt as well as slacks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-87 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> 88% polyester, 12% nylon | <strong>Sizes:</strong> 14/16–30/32 |<strong> Fit: </strong>Relaxed, flared sleeves | <strong>Colors:</strong> Black, cream</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-topshop-ribbed-turtleneck-sweater></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Topshop Ribbed Turtleneck Sweater</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you picture a cozy fall sweater, this ribbed turtleneck from Topshop is likely the image that comes to mind.

And unlike many of its counterparts, this sweater is definitively machine-washable for easy wear and wash over time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> 85% polyester, 15% acrylic | <strong>Sizes:</strong> XS–L |<strong> Fit: </strong>Chunky, oversized fit | <strong>Colors:</strong> Gray, orange | <strong>Cleaning:</strong> Machine washable, dry flat</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-amazon-essentials-lightweight-turtleneck></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-99 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Amazon Essentials Lightweight Turtleneck</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re seeking a basic fall turtleneck to add to your closet, this lightweight pick from Amazon comes in at a good price and with easy upkeep. Made with a cotton blend, the sweater can be machine-washed and hung to dry.

Acrylic fabric gives an almost wool-like feel, so the sweater is not only soft but has a good thickness to it, to keep you warm as fall turns to winter. In addition to the whimsical stripe, the sweater comes in three warm shades of beige, white, and green.

However, we’d recommend more lightweight fabrics for this season, while saving the thicker, warmer materials for winter. “Sure it has to look cute, but how does it feel?” asks Conroy. “While extremely warm, for those with sensitive skin wool can be itchy and uncomfortable.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-194 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A thick wool sweater isn’t really necessary for fall in most climates, so instead, consider pure cotton like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Frankie Cable Knit Sweater</a>, polyester like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Maeve Ribbed Turtleneck</a>, and various blends like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Winter Love Color Block Cardigan Sweater</a> (or even cashmere if you don’t mind a splurge). Conroy also suggests trying “a nylon, viscose, and wool blend” which is “much softer against your skin” or wearing a cotton layer underneath wool sweaters to “act as a barrier between the [material] and your skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-196 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most of these materials are fairly durable and should last for a long time, though you’ll frequently see “hand wash only” labels to extend the lifespan of the clothing. “I can’t wear a sweater if it’s not soft and cozy,” adds Kassab. “That’s the most important part for me, next to it looking good on my body.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-198 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-199 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only how a sweater fits your body, but also how it fits under other clothing, is an important quality to consider when we’re talking about the colder months ahead. If your interest is for standalone sweaters to ease into fall, then you have to decide what fit will be the most comfortable for you. “It’s easy for a sweater to not do anything for you so it’s important to find one that suits your shape the most,” says Kassab. “I love a cardigan and a crewneck myself.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-201 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Some prefer a thicker, chunky oversized silhouette like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Topshop Ribbed Turtleneck Sweater</a> for maximum coziness, while others like something a little more tailored and fitted such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Chic Observations Ribbed Turtleneck Sweater Top</a>. “Oversized or cropped sweaters are always fun, but the sheer nature of their design allows for more airflow, meaning it won’t keep you as warm,” says Conroy. Then consider the other outerwear you might wear with it, and a thinner sweater like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon Essentials Fisherman Cable Crewneck Sweater</a> creates more space inside of coats and jackets.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-203 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style and Weave</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-204 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve touched on the four major styles here: cardigans, turtlenecks, ribbed, and cable knits, but each really offers something unique. If you want a lighter, layering sweater, a cardigan like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Mango Decorative Seams Cardigan</a> is a great choice. Ribbed sweaters offer a bit of texture, and certain types like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Treasure & Bond One-Shoulder Rib Sweater</a> are a good balance of thickness so you can wear them as standalone pieces or comfortably layer them with thicker outerwear.

Pilling can happen with extended use, washing delicate materials, and general wear and tear over time. That said, certain materials are less likely to pill than others,&nbsp;such as cashmere, but these fabrics are usually a bit more expensive than your standard cotton, polyester, or rayon blend.&nbsp;(If you do experience pilling, we recommend buying a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">fabric shaver</a> to keep your knits in tip-top shape.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-212 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Splurge on a cashmere sweater for guaranteed softness and no itch factor,” says Conroy. “It’s an investment, but it means your new fall favorite will be much more durable than wool or a cotton and polyester blend.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-214 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should a sweater fit?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-215 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The right fit depends on the wearer and their preferences. With so many styles and silhouettes, there’s no shortage of choice, but you might want to consider the various ways you would wear the fall sweater to determine the best size or fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-217 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re going for an oversized, cozy option, sometimes you can size down and there’s still extra room. For sweaters you want to wear to the office or more formal occasions, you might go with something more fitted that could go under a blazer or be tucked into slacks or a skirt. And when it comes to tucking, sometimes chunky sweaters can prove difficult unless you use <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>the sweater tuck hack</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-219 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-220 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madison Yauger</a> is a senior commerce writer for PEOPLE who’s tested hundreds of lifestyle products across all categories.
