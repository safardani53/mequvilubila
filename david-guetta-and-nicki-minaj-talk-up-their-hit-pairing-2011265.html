Heck, half of the songs in the Top Ten on&nbsp;any given week get there this way (hence<strong> Chris Brown</strong>'s enduring career).</p><p>So, of course when<strong> David Guetta</strong> (whose done megatracks with everyone from&nbsp;<strong>Rihanna</strong> to the <strong>Black Eyed Peas </strong>and <strong>Kelly Rowland</strong>) tapped the great<strong> Nicki&nbsp;Minaj </strong>and Flo Rida to join him on his latest Top Ten smash, "Where Them&nbsp;Girls At?" you knew it was about to go off.</p><p>I recently caught up with Guetta and Minaj to find out how this all came&nbsp;came together. Here's what went down:</p><p><strong>US</strong>: How did you come across each other, find out about each other, and how&nbsp;did you come to collaborate on the song?</p><p><strong>DG</strong>: I was a big fan of Nicki Minaj so I was following her work. I thought&nbsp;she had an incredible flow and voice. When I checked her out I was impressed&nbsp;and I wanted to work with her. It was hard finding the time because we are&nbsp;both busy but we made it happen and I am so glad. I hope we work some more&nbsp;together.</p><p><strong>NM</strong>: I had been a fan of his big dance records- of course I heard them in the&nbsp;car, in the club, everywhere. I had no idea that this man was behind any of&nbsp;these dope records. So when he said 'oh that was me,' I was instantly a fan&nbsp;because I was like 'woah, you are a creative genius dude.' He seems like the&nbsp;type of dude you want to party with and he’s very inviting so I fell for him&nbsp;the first day I met him. He had been trying to work with me when I was&nbsp;finishing up Pink Friday so I told him I’d meet him another time. When I&nbsp;went to Paris, he was there too and asked if I could come by the studio. I&nbsp;wanted to do a solo song. but he wanted me on a Flo Rida record and I said&nbsp;'no I'm not interested' because I’ve been doing so many features. After he&nbsp;played the Flo Rida song I changed my opinion in 5.2 seconds and I was like&nbsp;'oh I am doing this song.' It was just a feel good record. It sounded big&nbsp;and it felt great. And next thing you know, I was back home in LA recording,&nbsp;'Where Them Girls At.' I changed the hook so it was from a female standpoint&nbsp;and I wrote my verse and the bridge and he loved it. I was just being crazy&nbsp;in the studio because if felt good. We might have a couple more surprises up&nbsp;our sleeves.</p><p><strong>US</strong>: You both are collaborating with big time musicians. How did your&nbsp;relationship with these artists start and how did it evolve?</p><p><strong>DG</strong>: The Black Eyed Peas and I have an amazing relationship, were like a&nbsp;family. I met Will in a club in Ibiza but he didn’t know who I was. He said&nbsp;he came up to the DJ booth because that is where the hot girls were. One&nbsp;year after he called me not realizing I was the same guy. He loved my music&nbsp;and asked if I would make some beats for the Black Eyed Peas album. I was&nbsp;very surprised because no one from that world came to see me except Usher.&nbsp;Since that day we haven't stopped making music together. We always keep in&nbsp;touch and help each other out. We've done some concerts together. Sometimes&nbsp;we just call each other just to play a beat that is really crazy.</p><p><strong>NM</strong>: I did a remix for<strong> Britney Spears </strong>to 'Til The World Ends' but I met her a&nbsp;few weeks ago at a gay club. Gay club's have more energy, so when Britney&nbsp;walked in the room, there was a roar over the entire crowd. It was special&nbsp;for us to meet and take pictures there because this is our diehard fan base.&nbsp;She said, 'oh thank you for doing this' and I was like 'oh, no thank you for&nbsp;having me.' We can’t wait to get out on the road. It’s going to be super&nbsp;duper exciting. The club was loud so we didn’t have an hour-long business&nbsp;conversation.&nbsp; We danced and had fun and in the blink of an eye, it was all&nbsp;over. <strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong> was there too looking stunning! She’s skinnier than&nbsp;me, so I don’t understand because her weight is clearly not an issue. I saw&nbsp;her and I was like 'whoa! she looks really, really good!’</p><p><strong>Us</strong>: What are you most excited about, being on the road with her?</p><p><strong>NM</strong>:&nbsp;I’m honored to be out with Britney. She’s freakin’ paved the way for pop&nbsp;culture. I’m excited. We are in talks to hit the stage together but that is&nbsp;up to her. I would love to of course. If we do something on tour, it will&nbsp;probably be the remix. I’m sure there are so many things I’m going to learn&nbsp;just by watching her. Next year, I’ll be headlining my own tour so this is&nbsp;my time to be a student and to learn and to absorb all of this information&nbsp;and then take that knowledge and create an amazing Pink Friday tour at the&nbsp;top of 2012.</p><p><strong>US</strong>: So how do you go about getting all of these people to collaborate with&nbsp;you?</p><p><strong>DG</strong>: Those guys they called me and asked me to produce but after this I&nbsp;received a bunch of calls from people in the industry. The only person I&nbsp;chased was Nicki Minaj and I'm happy I did it because really she killed that&nbsp;record, the "Where Dem Girls At." She is huge in America but in Europe I&nbsp;think there is more work that needs to be done so she is as known as she&nbsp;should be. She will be a huge star in Europe. This is only the beginning of&nbsp;her career.</p><p><strong>Us</strong>: It was rumored that you wanted to hold back on doing the collaborations&nbsp;for a while and just focus on your own solo stuff. Was this an exception to&nbsp;that?</p><p><strong>NM</strong>: When I said that I knew there was almost no way I could hold that&nbsp;promise. Especially because I’m on Young Money and my teammates are always&nbsp;putting out albums. Of course I’m not going to not get on a <strong>Wayne</strong> album or a&nbsp;<strong>Drake</strong> album. I’m being more selective. I’ve been turning a lot down because&nbsp;I want to make my work very powerful so they stand out.</p><p><strong>Us</strong>: Do you have any other collaborations coming up?</p><p><strong>DG</strong>: I would make the album that I am making right now. it is really crazy.</p><p><strong>NM</strong>: I’ll be on Tha Carter IV with Wayne and I’m sure I’ll have something on&nbsp;Drake’s Take Care album. As of right now, there is one more but I’m going to&nbsp;keep it a secret. It’s with a lady, who I’m a big fan of. I’m focusing on my&nbsp;single, "Super Bass." I would love to collaborate with <strong>Beyonce</strong>, She’s really&nbsp;defined what a female entertainer is for my&nbsp;generation. I’m very content with the ones I’ve done. I'm good.</p><p><strong>Us</strong>: Are you shocked by how much you have dominated the charts in the last&nbsp;few years or was this always the plan?</p><p><strong>DG</strong>: It was not planned. I've been making music for more than ten years and&nbsp;I've been a DJ for twenty years so I feel the spirit to mix. While working&nbsp;with the Black Eyed Peas I was able to create something fresh and new. I am&nbsp;still making tracks and playing my DJ set and I am still growing musically. I want to make songs that can touch the people from my community and others because the songs are so emotional that they touch people regardless of their style.</p><p><strong>Us</strong>: How do you feel about being influential and a role model for your fans?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>NM</strong>: I feel so blessed and I am humbled by it. When I go places and see girls dressed like me, it’s exciting but it’s a shock because I didn’t know I was going to touch so many people. Fans are like family. I did a meet and great on the Wayne tour and these kids have life-changing stories to tell me and who knew? It’s more than them dressing up like me, they’re really connected to me on an emotional level as well. They’ve just become a part of my life and it’s amazing. I’m thankful for them.</p><p>By <strong>Ian Drew </strong>for <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.
