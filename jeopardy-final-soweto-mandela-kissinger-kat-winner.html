OBAMA? WTF?'</h2><p>Game show fans are excited to see how Kat will go but had to admit some of the responses offered just stung.</p><p>Especially since quite a few of them did not have to do with Soweto in South Africa.</p><p>One fan tweeted: "I'm sorry but that Final Jeopardy clue was too easy for all of them to not get it. Kissinger and Merkel?"</p><p>"She thought Mandela and Obama lived on the same street?!?! Ever in life? On what continent?" wrote another about Kat's guess.</p><p>One viewer wrote on Reddit: "I was a bit surprised that FJ was a triple stumper. I hope Kat has a nice run."</p><p>A second replied: "More than a bit surprised here. And some of those guesses - still better to write something, but oof!"</p><p>A third harshly blasted: "lmao those FJ guesses."</p><p>And a fourth wrote: "Henry Kissinger? WTF?"</p><p>A sixth said: "Who are the only South Africans to win the Nobel Peace Prize? Jumpin' Jeepers, that was a triple stumper?"</p><p>One contestant whose episode is airing this week defended in the forum: "There were about six or so of us in the contestant waiting area who didn't get it either!"</p><h2>FLUCTUATING FINAL JEOPARDY CLUES</h2><p>Some fans have grumbled that Final Jeopardy clues lately have oscillated between extremely difficult - there have been at five "triple stumpers" in the past 10 days per <a href=#>Jeopardy.com </a>- and shockingly easy.</p><p>Yesterday's Final Jeopardy read: "In 1966, the year of his death, he shared plans for an experimental prototype community in Florida."</p><p>Everyone was correct with Walt Disney and fans did not feel this was a fairytale ending for a quiz show episode.</p><p>"I’m a bit perplexed by Final Jeopardy today, not because there was a problem with it, but that clue felt like it should have been on the $200 space in the Jeopardy round, not an FJ answer," one person wrote on Reddit.</p><p>"Literally the easiest Final Jeopardy ever," commented another fan.</p><p>That said,&nbsp;<a href=#>3-day champ Brian Henegar</a> took to Reddit to divulge some<a href=#>&nbsp;behind-the-scenes moments</a>&nbsp;from his time on the show last week.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy! champion</a>&nbsp;responded to fans questions in an AMA or "Ask Me Anything."</p><p><a href=#>Brian</a>&nbsp;brought up his third Final Jeopardy under "Fashion History" which read: "These decorative items get their name from their origin in the port city of Strasbourg, on the border of France & Germany."</p><p>No one was correct with "rhinestones," at the time which host&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken</a> had admitted was a tough get.</p><p>He told the players: "Strasbourg is a port on the rhine river, which is how rhinestones get their name. Kind of a tricky one."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Brian told internet users "<a href=#>On the third game</a>&nbsp;(with the rhinestone FJ!),&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;mentioned that he stared at that clue for five minutes before it hit him."</p><p>Another&nbsp;<a href=#>game show</a>&nbsp;fan responded: "Very interesting. That should be a pretty good indication to the writers that maybe the clue is a bit too difficult."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/taken-without-permission-mandela-effect-809296684.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-11-at-6.55.25-PM.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-11-at-6.59.03-PM.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaGp9dX%2BXaKGep6CWv6XFjJ%2Bgp5mcYsCww8StpmalkaOxprjAZqKiq6Oeu6ix0WaimqxdrLavusSrZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./justin-bieber-jerry-visit-great-britain.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Justin Bieber, Jerry Visit Great Britain">&larr;
