I freaked out.</p><p>"She was screaming, and the kids were screaming."</p><p>The statement disclosed the horrifying details around the stabbing of the three victims of what the court documents described as "the beginning of one of the most horrifying events that has ever taken place."</p><p>As Robin began to scream for help, Robitaille abandoned Alisa and found a steak knife in the kitchen.</p><p>Robin was able to escape out of the kitchen door, but Robitaille caught her and brought her back into the house where "he broke the blade of one steak knife off in her back and got another and followed her into her bedroom."</p><p>Allegedly, he then went upstairs to where Alisa and Trent were.</p><p>Standing on top of the steps, Alisa reportedly asked him: "Why are you doing this?"</p><p>Robitaille allegedly responded that he had "gone too far now."</p><p>According to the statement, he found Trent in a storage area behind a bedroom.</p><h2>SHOCKINGLY GRAPHIC DETAILS</h2><p>During the convicted murderer's testimony, a pathologist with the Alabama Department of Forensics testified that Alisa's body had 18 stab wounds, Robin was stabbed 17 times, and Trent had 10 stab wounds.</p><p>Jurors reportedly saw graphic and detailed slides of the stab wounds taken during the autopsy and the Taylor family left the courtroom so they did not have to see the photos.</p><p>The wounds ranged graphically from one to six inches deep, while one wound went entirely through the young boy's body, and Alisa's wounds came from four weapons.</p><p>Robitaille allegedly proceeded to steal jars of spare change, Alisa's purse and its contents, and the murder knives, weapons, and scissors, before fleeing their residence.</p><p>The statements show that he apparently drove to Birmingham to his girlfriend's, Lisa Thomas, where he discarded the murder weapons and she washed his bloody pants.</p><p>Lisa was charged with bail for abetting Robitaille and he was arrested in Birmingham where he initially denied his crime.</p><p>He confessed two days later as he said: "I read a little Christian pamphlet in the cell.</p><p>"I've always believed in God, but (the pamphlet) was telling me to tell the truth. That's what I want to do, now."</p><p>He concluded: "I didn't mean to hurt anyone."</p><p>Robitaille was sentenced to the death penalty and then appealed, considering it cruel and unusual punishment, although his capital murder convictions and his sentence of death were affirmed.</p><p>Over 20 years later, Robitaille is still on death row in the state of Alabama.</p><h2>HANNAH'S HEARTBREAK</h2><p>Hannah confessed in her memoir: "When my mom told us that somebody had come into their house and 'hurt them,' it terrified me in the deepest parts of my heart."</p><p>The <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a> winner continued: "I didn't know the whole story with all the details until years later, but coming that close to something so awful, so terrifying - it was a turning point for me."</p><p>She added: "It changed everything. I was no longer living in the innocence of an untouched childhood."</p><p>Hannah said that her family occasionally saw mentions of the investigation and the trial as it came up on their news, but that her parents always changed the channel, wanting to forget about it.</p><p>She confessed that even though it frightened her, she wanted to know more, and looked up the details of the case on the Internet.</p><p>Hannah shared that after being diagnosed with narcolepsy in her adulthood, she has always wondered if it was a "direct symptom of the trauma of the murder itself."</p><h2>PETE'S CHANCE</h2><p>Hannah's book not only details her childhood trauma, but also her relationship with&nbsp;<a href=#>Bachelor</a>&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=#>Peter Weber.</a></p><p>The former couple had a strong connection during Hannah's season of The Bachelorette in 2019 before she ultimately chose Jed Wyatt in the finale, whom she eventually broke up with.</p><p>Pete, 30, then returned to his quest for love starring as the Bachelor the following season.</p><p>In a conversation with&nbsp;<a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, she revealed that the exes were&nbsp;<a href=#>intimate during Pete's season</a>&nbsp;as the leading man.</p><p>She told the publication: "I was so upset breaking up with him. I know he really did care about me and he's such a great guy. I was really confused."</p><p>She also confessed hearing Pete was continuing his run on the show helped her move on.</p><p>She said: "Once I knew it helped shield my feelings for him. I still didn't know if I could get there with him."</p><p>However, they later did reconnect when she appeared on an episode of his season.</p><p>"Going back and seeing him as the Bachelor, it brought up a lot," she said, adding Pete made a declaration off-camera to keep their romance going.</p><p>"Peter told me he'd quit the show, 100 percent if I could say that I wanted to be with him. I wanted to go on a date with him, but I couldn't say that I knew for sure."</p><p>Pete ended up proposing to Hannah Ann Sluss on the show before ending their engagement to explore a relationship with another woman, runner-up Madison Prewett.</p><h2>INTIMATE MOMENT</h2><p>Meanwhile, Pete and Hannah crossed paths again while at a party together, as the TV star recalled in her book that they ended up in bed together.</p><p>"The chemistry just wasn't there. It just sucked. And then, I found out he had another girl [Madison] on his mind. It was all so bizarre," she recounted.</p><p>The two broke off communication for good after that night as Hannah said she is happy with the place she is in.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Things might not have turned out the way I expected, but I try to learn from every moment. I don't wish ill on anybody. And I'm in a really good place."</p><p>The TV personality has since found love with boyfriend&nbsp;<a href=#>Adam Woolard.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695706289.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695646053.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000695706255.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Bachelorette Hannah Brown reveals aunt and cousins, 4 and 6, were MURDERED in home invasion which left star 'terrified'</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYWh9cnySaJmam5iaubC%2BxK2rnmWYlruvrcdmmaunp6N6p63MoqOyZZueua2x0WabnpmknXqzu9Zo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-berman-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CNN's John Berman Married Life With Wife &amp;amp; Estimated Salary Revealed!
