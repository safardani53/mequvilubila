Stings to see Jilana get cut short in second place."</p><p>A third wrote: "It looked like Aaron just stopped trying to even buzz in for the final five or so questions of today's game!?"</p><p>A fourth posted: "Poor guy didn't even get to play final <strong>jeopardy</strong> but then ends up in 2nd?!"</p><p>A fifth wrote: "In my opinion you earned more than the 3rd place score on the scoreboard suggests."</p><p>A sixth applauded: "Jilana really almost accomplished that monster comeback and I honestly thought she would."</p><p>A seventh wrote: "Jeopardy would be the most riveting show on TV if they always had contestants as good and evenly matched as Jilana and Emily.</p><p>That was a nail-biter till the very end, and I wish there’s some way both of them could have won."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>And an eighth wrote about Jilana: "She did pretty good though. And she is going to have a baby in December!
