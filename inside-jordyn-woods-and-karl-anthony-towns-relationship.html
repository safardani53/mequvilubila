The beauty and the NBA star player make an excellent couple, as seen on their Instagram. Towns and Woods have been together for a little over two years, and there are a few characteristics that distinguish them. One possibility is that they are connected by sorrow, and another is that they were friends for years before getting romantically linked. One thing that strikes out on their Instagram, though, is how they treat one other. Or, to be more specific, how Towns treats Woods like the queen she is.</p><h2>Jordyn Woods’s boyfriend goes to great lengths for her.</h2><p>The couple’s second-anniversary party is a good illustration of how wonderfully Towns treats his fiancée. On May 21, 2022, the couple celebrated their second anniversary.&nbsp;Towns had devised a lengthy schedule. He initially lavished her with presents, including a Bottega Veneta striped dress, Gianvito Rossi shoes, and a Chanel purse. She wore them to their favorite restaurant, Nobu Malibu, for a romantic lunch. But the show had only just started.</p><p>Towns then brought her to San Ysidro Ranch in Santa Barbara without notifying Woods. When she arrived, she was given a few more items from Versace’s Fendi collaboration, Finance, as well as a few more Chanel and Gucci pieces and a professional photographer to take photographs with.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jordyn-Woods-2.jpg alt="Jordyn Woods " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She recorded everything on Instagram and TikTok, and on May 21, she commented, “greatest anniversary weekend.”</p><p>“I adore you, @karltowns,” she said at the conclusion of the post. “You make me feel like a queen and remind me of it every day.”</p><p>This, however, was not a one-time procedure. She is accustomed to being indulged by Towns, which he seemed to love a lot. They go on sushi dates, Vegas getaways, and impromptu visits to Disney World and other destinations on his private aircraft on a regular basis.&nbsp;Woods also got a Porsche Taycan for Christmas in 2021, as well as a slew of other, smaller presents to go along with the festive theme. However, treating someone like a queen isn’t only about money and other possessions. It’s also about trust and appreciation. The NBA star is fully aware of this.</p><p>Rumors circulated in March 2021 that Towns had cheated on Woods. A few doctored screenshots began circulating, implying he was contacting another lady behind her back in December 2020.</p><p>He, on the other hand, was not in the mood to consider anything of the like. So he turned to Twitter to explain things while also praising Woods.</p><p>“So, I have the baddest female in the game, and you think I’m going to spend my efforts on anybody else?” he wrote. “GTFOH! The same detractors we have today will be there when I put that ring on her finger.”</p><p>The post sparked engagement speculations, but they have yet to tie the knot.</p><h2>Relationship between Jordyn Woods and Karl-Anthony Towns</h2><p>Woods and Towns’ relationship began as a friendship. They met via common connections, formed a relationship, and eventually became best friends. They even considered themselves to be brothers and sisters at one time.&nbsp;Everything was normal until the epidemic struck. Among the eight family members, Towns lost to COVID was his mother, Jacqueline Cruz.&nbsp;Woods knew his anguish since she had lost her father to cancer in 2017.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jordyn-Woods-3.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“Naturally, we both related over losing a parent at a young age,” she said in September 2020 to Extra. The circumstance compelled them to reconsider their relationship.&nbsp;“It pushed us to decide whether we wanted to keep our friendship or pursue something more serious. And we went with the latter “Towns said this in a September 2021 episode of Woods’ IG series, Regular-ish. The pair found it easy to form a love relationship since they were closest friends and knew everything about one other. When they got into disagreements, it was their foundation of friendship and communication that saved them.&nbsp;And they’re already expanding their family. They just acquired a dog they discovered on their morning coffee run.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigp6uZmbJuts6rm7KmXay8sLDSZpinnF2grrO4jJqlraCfo8ZuwM6wpaxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./meghan-markle-rewears-her-white-gold-earrings-from-last-royals-appearance-in-2020.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meghan Markle Rewears Her Earrings from Last Royals Appearance in 2020">&larr;
