Long may he reign!"</p><p>Jared continued: "If you had to handpick a category that I would be least thrilled to see for Final, it would be something to do with politics or international organizations.</p><p>"I've just never found the subject interesting to follow or study, and it proved to be my undoing.</p><p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone at Jeopardy for making my dreams come true beyond anything I could have hoped."</p><p>And thank you to everyone who has supported me on this journey.</p><p>"The hardest part of leaving now is feeling like I let those rooting for me down by not going further. Dorkapotamus [a nickname he referred to himself as earlier on] out."</p><p>Suresh replied: Thanks a lot Jared! You were both an awesome player and an awesome person to hang out with in the green room.</p><p>That was a great run and a great game as well. Sorry about the Final Jeopardy category."</p><h2>JARED'S JEOPARDY! JOURNEY</h2><p>Jared is a married father-of-one and a <a href=#>semi-pro guitar player (he did a winning rendition of the Think music on YouTube)</a>. He shared on stage he is allergic to cats but “I have two anyway.”</p><p>Even he was <a href=#>rocked by his first win last Thursday</a>, as he went into the last round in second place.</p><p>Jared buckled over his podium looking absolutely thrilled over the come-from-behind win being correct on Final Jeopardy and pulling ahead.</p><p>“Oh man!” he said, and Mayim replied: “Oh man is right!”&nbsp;</p><p>As the credits rolled Jared said to the host in a made-for-<a href=#>TV</a>&nbsp;moment: "I can't words right now."</p><p>Jared wrote to Reddit at the time: "At no point in the game did I think I was actually going to win."</p><p>He then won Friday's game with a&nbsp;<a href=#>solid $24K.</a></p><h2>'DEFINITELY A SOUR NOTE'</h2><p>However, Jared made <a href=#>two rough guesses</a> during his third win on yesterday's episode and he heard it from fans.</p><p>A clue read: "The Japanese Garden is a good place to get away from the bustle of the 12 million or so people living in the area of this city."</p><p>Jared was the first to quickly buzz in, and guessed: "What is Tokyo?"</p><p>Mayim gave a stern, "No" before calling on Annabelle, who gave the correct response, "What is Manilla?"</p><p>Fans online could hardly believe Jared botched the clue since the category was "The Phillipines."</p><p>"Dear Jared, Tokyo is not in the Philippines," one person mocked as another responded: "I know, right?</p><p>Then, Final Jeopardy featured the category "Acronyms," with the clue: "It was originally a code word used by telegraph operators;&nbsp;<a href=#>Barack Obama</a>&nbsp;used it in his Twitter handle."</p><p>Both Annabelle and Harrison correctly guessed: "What is POTUS?" - which is short for President of the United States while Jared guessed: "STOP."</p><p>Once again, the internet let him have it for his POTUS faux pas.</p><p>"Not gonna lie, the Final Jeopardy! was pretty straightforward, but I was absolutely shocked that Jared was the only one to miss that Final," one person commented, before adding an optimistic: "I still have high hopes for him in his future games."</p><p>Once more on <a href=#>Reddit</a>, Jared copped to the gaffes and wrote: "Total brain fart. "No excuse except to say that sometimes... it just happens."</p><p>He continued: "Ah yes, the venerable Filipino city of... Tokyo? I really can't explain what I was thinking there except to say that I clearly forgot the category. I can't wait to have the Internet throw that one back at me all day.</p><p>"With Final, it was definitely a case of me way overthinking it. I knew President Obama used POTUS in his Twitter handle, but the telegraph portion of the clue threw me off, because I had assumed that acronym to be much more recently created.</p><p>"Thankfully it did not cost me the game, but it was definitely a sour note."</p><p>Although Jared did not punch his ToC ticket the 2024 Ken-hosted tournament is expanding to 10 weeks with a new <a href=#>Champions Wildcard addition for three-day (and fewer) winners.</a></p><h2>WHAT IS: THE JEOPARDY!
