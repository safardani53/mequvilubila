Unfortunately, this is what we’ve learned to expect from people on social media.</p><p>Next time, when the Cowboys take on the Los Angeles Chargers, maybe supporters will be more optimistic.</p><h2>Dawn Elliott | Popularity</h2><p>Ezekiel’s mother is popular for her bolt tweet in support of his son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dawn-elliot-popularity.jpg><p>This images shows the popularity graph of Dawn Elliott, mother of Ezekiel Elliott.</p><h2>Dawn Elliott | FAQs</h2><h3>Does Dawn Elliott like his son Ezekiel Elliott’s ‘Feed Me’ tattoo?</h3><p>After scoring a touchdown in a season-opening defeat to the Rams, the Cowboys running back flaunted his new tattoo on Sunday night.
