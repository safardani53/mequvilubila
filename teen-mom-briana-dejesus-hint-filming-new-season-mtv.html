I put myself&nbsp; on the back burner to make sure my kids are ok, my mom is ok.”</p><p>She noted that it's "too much" for her to continue doing.&nbsp;</p><p>Briana shared her thoughts as she got strapped into a harness and her mom Roxanne, tagging along for the&nbsp;<a href=#>MTV</a>&nbsp;series, stepped away from the group.</p><p>“It pains me to hear my daughter Briana say that," she confessed.&nbsp;</p><p>Her daughter, however, was confused by her distance.</p><p>She said in a confessional: “I’m the backbone for everybody in the family and it’s a lot of the pressure … I need my mom right now and she’s walking away.”</p><p>She went on: “Is she about to leave and not watch me jump off this bridge? I definitely need my mom right now and she just walked off.”</p><p>The pair finally came together before Briana's jump, with Roxanne explaining through tears: “It freaks me out. My anxiety. I can’t.”</p><p>She noted, "That is so far down," and added, "accidents happen."</p><p>In the end, however, she decided to put her fear aside and be there for Briana.&nbsp;</p><p>Coach B, who was leading the experience and will continue to guide the retreat, assured Briana: “Your mom is saying ‘I got your back.’”</p><p>At that point, she started to break down.</p><p>Briana patted tears from her eyes as she got ready to take the plunge.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, she admitted: “Jumping off that bridge released so much pressure for me.”</p><h2>DRAMA INCOMING</h2><p>While the first episode of the show packed an emotional punch, <a href=#>Briana has teased big drama ahead</a>.</p><p>She claimed the rest of the season is a "hot mess express."</p><p>It was previously revealed that production was halted after she and co-star Ashley Jones got into a heated fight.</p><p>Briana teased the drama incoming as Teen Mom: The Next Chapter came to a close.</p><p>She tweeted at the time: “Season finale coming up only means Teen Mom: Family Reunion will start soon.”</p><p>She warned her fans: “And that s**t was a hot mess express,” adding two laughing emojis</p><p>Although the cast for the new season has yet to be announced, fans are already bracing themselves for drama.</p><p>The U.S. Sun previously reported how a&nbsp;<a href=#>fight broke out</a>&nbsp;between Briana and Ashley, 25, and their mothers, Roxanne and Tea Chapple, during the filming of Family Reunion in August.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley’s Reality Roundup</a>, the fight lasted several days and resulted in the&nbsp;<a href=#>production crew going on strike</a>.</p><p>Per the outlet, Ashley spat on her cast member during a bitter disagreement while filming.</p><p>Members of the camera crew and sound technicians subsequently put down their equipment at the resort in Oregon where the spin-off was being filmed.&nbsp;</p><p>The fight began during one of the first cast meals, a source told The Ashley’s Reality Roundup.</p><p>The cast was allegedly having a conversation about supporting one another on social media when things got ugly.&nbsp;</p><p>"Roxanne made a comment about how the grandmas from the show need to be supportive of each other and [Tea] took it as a jab at her," an insider said.&nbsp;</p><p>"She told Roxanne to say what she wanted to say, so Roxanne started talking about some of the stuff Tea has said about Briana on social media."</p><p>The source added: "They started screaming and cussing at each other and tried to get at each other but it was broken up by security."</p><p>However, that wasn't the end of the drama.</p><p>Several sources alleged that things got even more intense later that evening inside the resort.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Ashley and Tea walked up on [Roxanne and Briana] in the kitchen and they all started screaming at each other," one source alleged.</p><p>"That's when it turned physical. Ashley spit on Briana, and then someone started throwing stuff. It got more physical before it was finally broken up. But all four of the women were fighting each other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/taken-without-permission-im-working-786704911.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/teen-mom-briana-dejesus-breaks-786346181-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/01/teen-mom-star-briana-dejesus-770688869.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYGuFcYOXaKuenZ5iurC5jJupopmelnqlscmeqq6rXZ22r8CMn6ClpZmjtG66xLBkrJ2RqLyvecytrWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./uk-weather-met-office-travel-chaos-rain-flooding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="UK weather: Met Office warns of travel chaos and flooding with 1.5 inches of rain to hit... and ther">&larr;
