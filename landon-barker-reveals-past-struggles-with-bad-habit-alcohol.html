It was honestly awful.”</p><p>The “Die in California” musician said it was an experience that he “had gone through for months,” noting that he now drinks in moderation.</p><p>“I think 100 percent it’s important for me to not make that a habit again,” he said of drinking. “I always tell myself, ‘I’ll only drink on special occasions now.’ I just steer away from everything.”</p><p>Other than struggling with alcohol, Landon opened up with <a href=#>his other mental health issues</a>, including “OCD, ADHD and anxiety,” explaining that he had a rough patch with “dissociation” in 2022.</p><p>“[It] kind of just hit me like a truck last year and it was just the most awful experience,” he recalled. “It kind of started with, I would drink, and then the day after, I would disassociate really bad, and that’s kind of how my habit of drinking a lot started. It was like, ‘Oh, I’d feel better the second that I had a drink.’”</p><p>However, a medical issue helped him realize that he “couldn’t drink” regularly anymore.</p><p>“When I got my concussion, I kind of just had to deal with it and I would just, I don’t know, I just hated life for three or four months. It was pretty awful,” Landon shared. “I remember I would just go to the hospital once a week just because I would have such bad panic attacks from everything that was going on.”</p><p>He’s since learned how to cope by researching “tips and tricks” to <a href=#>deal with his issues</a>.</p><p>“Honestly, I was a little bit too scared to start medication,” Landon added. “I just know how I get just having kind of an addictive personality, and I feel like I would be too scared to put myself in a dependent situation where I must use something every single day. I was just a little bit too nervous to even try it, but I was doing a lot of therapy and working out, and it was helpful.”</p><p>Another thing that helped him get through the hard times was creating music. Landon released his debut single, <a href=#>“Friends With Your EX”</a> last month, but he’s also collaborated with <a href=#><strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong></a> on the<a href=#> song “Die in California.”</a></p><p>When Kelly, 33, heard Landon singing the track when they shared a studio, the rapper decided to put the song on his 2022 <a href=#>Mainstream Sellout</a> album.</p><p>“It was kind of like a song that started out with an idea, something about not liking the person that you used to be,” Landon said of the collab. “But basically, it’s like a mental health song, kind of going through it, but it just formed into what it is today, naturally and supernaturally.”</p><p>Through his music and social media, Landon has since realized that it’s easier to speak publicly about his issues.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“All the messages that I got when I posted about it <a href=#>honestly made me feel better</a>,” he said. “Looking to the public for support and more knowledge was honestly comforting for me and letting people know truly who I am, even on my phone through a social media platform was actually kind of helpful for me.”</p><p>In addition to his music, Landon has made headlines for his love life, making appearances on girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Charli D’Amelio</strong></a>’s Hulu series, <a href=#>The D’Amelio Show</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZ6ZvK95wZqppJ2iYr%2BmwsSao6xloJbAtXnSramun5ehsrR51qKroWWSlrFutMCboK1lkaGwsLTOpWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./philadelphia-flyers-gritty-pics-mascot-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pics Of The New Hockey Mascot  Hollywood Life">&larr;
