Begin?</h2><p>It is unclear how or when Ana and Ball started dating, but every now and then, they drop some hints on social media pointing out to each other.</p><p>While the couple has not shared pictures with each other,<strong> their flirty exchanges on social media suggest they are indeed an item.</strong></p><p>In January 2022, Ball updated an Instagram post that included a photo of Ana

a photo and video of herself in the <strong>grey logo sweatshirt and blue knee-high boots.</strong></p><p>In the comments, she wrote, ‚ÄúLaFrance & u 4 the win,‚Äù with a pink heart emoji.</p><p>Even though they have yet to address their relationship status, sharing the picture from behind was a step up from their usual flirty exchanges.</p><p>However, Chavez has been criticized for their 13-years age difference.</p><h2>Ball & Ana Now</h2><p>In July 2022, LaMelo gushed over Ana on Twitter when he<strong> reacted to the snaps of the model posing in a one-piece</strong> by Fashion Nova.</p><p>He

3-piece set to which Melo commented, ‚Äúsheesh üòçüòçüíï.‚Äù</p><p>This only goes to prove their unconditional love for one another.</p><h2>Involvement In Prostitution</h2><p>In December 2022, a delicate topic for Hornets guard LaMelo Ball hit the headlines as his girlfriend Ana was accused of being a part of a prostitution ring.</p><p>Ana‚Äôs admirers flooded the comment section on Instagram with questions about the situation and where the rumors came from.</p><p>One of the fans talked about her going to Dubai and Nigeria to do sex work, but Ana was reluctant to accept the rumors.</p><p>These rumors came as a total shock for everybody, but Ana remained firm and denied everything she‚Äôd been accused of.</p><p>She said that she had never witnessed prostitution with her friends. She even said she <strong>never went to Nigeria and Dubai</strong> as part of the alleged ring.</p><p>Chaves&nbsp;also posted&nbsp;to TikTok video and expressed her frustration&nbsp;about it all.&nbsp;</p><h2>All About LaMelo Ball Girlfriend Ana Montana</h2><p>Ana Montana is an Instagram influencer with over 2.7 million followers as of this writing.</p><p>She was born Analicia Chaves in Bedford, Massachusetts, United States, sometime in 1989.</p><p>Ana graduated from Bedford High School in 2008.</p><p>She came to the limelight when she was spotted on the arm of <strong>Real Madrid soccer</strong> player <a href=#>Karim Benzema</a>.</p><p>Ana has not left the spotlight ever since.
