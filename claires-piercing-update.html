In hindsight, I clearly should have looked first."</p><p>Visiting the store in Princes Quay, Hull, Joanna was told she didn't need to make an appointment and was handed a board of earrings to choose from while they waited in line.</p><p>Options on the board included different materials, including stainless steel, yellow gold, gold plated metal and titanium, just to name a few.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000483887467.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000483887480.jpg><p>But to her confusion, the parenting blogger found that there were no prices alongside any of the choices - leaving the mother and daughter to pick blindly.</p><p>"At this point Jasmine was starting to get nervous, so my focus was on her and not on the price," Joanna continued. "But we still weren't given any guidance.</p><p>"I thought the 18ct gold looked good, so when it was Jasmine's turn she pointed to the ones she wanted from the box, which also had a 3mm crystal."</p><p>It wasn't until mum Joanne was presented with the paperwork to sign that she found out the sparkly pair would set her back £68.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000483887459.jpg><p>She said: "The assistant got the earrings out and showed us them - at this point she told me they were £68. I thought I'd misheard her, but when I questioned, she confirmed the cost.</p><p>"She could tell I was shocked, but as she didn't go on to tell me about any cheaper options, I assumed the prices for all the earrings must have been similar. So I found myself muttering 'that's fine'."</p><p>Too embarrassed to ask is there was anything cheaper, before she knew it, Jasmine's ears were pierced, and Joanne was left £68 lighter.</p><p>To make matters worse, Joanne was also encouraged to splash out £10 for their rapid cleaning solution - pushing her total even higher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000483887469.jpg><p>"It was only after I looked online and saw prices start from just £15 - so I do feel robbed that there are much more reasonable options available that weren't pointed out.</p><p>"If I had seen the prices, I wouldn't have gone for the cheapest £15 stainless steel option, but instead of the 18ct gold, I might have chosen the 24ct gold plated at £30.</p><p>"Even though my daughter loves her earrings, I'm sharing this in the hope of helping another parent not to make the same mistake I did."</p><p>A spokeswoman from Claire's Accessories responded to Joanne: "Our prices are based on the cost of the metal and any stones used. 24ct gold plated earrings cost from £20-30, titanum from £22-30, 9ct gold from £35-50, 18ct gold from £48-68 and the 9ct gold diamond are £90."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>In other news, this <a href=#>mum raged online after her ex-partner pierced their 9-week-old</a> daughter's ears without telling her.</p><p>While an <a href=#>expert claimed that ear piercing can tackle migraines, hunger and period pains</a>.</p><p>And this psychic hairdresser who <a href=#>predicted her child would be born with a full head of hair</a> gives birth to baby girl with locks so thick she's mistaken for a doll.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Holly Willoughby gets her ears re-pierced live on This Morning</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5dxb3JvYmp8pLjAoqmeq12ltqa%2BwqKloGWlpbGiwMRo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./viking-coin-15000-discovered.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Viking coin worth 15,000 more than 1,000 years old discovered in &amp;quot;find of a lifetime&amp;quot;">&larr;
