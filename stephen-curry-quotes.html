It’s just what you feel comfortable with, to trust that, and don’t let anybody box you in to a certain style of parenting or make you feel a certain way about what your kids do.”― <a href=#>Stephen Curry</a></p><p>“I want to thank God, obviously for the health, for the talent He’s given me, for my family who supports me, for the things that basketball’s taught me on and off the court. For the people that I’ve been able to meet through the game of basketball.”―<a href=#> Stephen Curry</a></p><p>“With the NBA’s dress code, I had to revamp my wardrobe a little bit.

He’s paid the ultimate price for us, so I’m proud to be a child of God.”― Stephen Curry</p><p>“Water is my drink.”― Stephen Curry</p><p>“With all the travel we’re doing to cold-weather cities, your mind definitely starts to wander. It gets you away from the game. Even when you arrive in a city, you’re tempted to just sit in your hotel and rest.
