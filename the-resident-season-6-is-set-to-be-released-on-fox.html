The controversial medical drama, created by Amy Holden Jones, Hayley Schore, and Roshan Sethi, follows physicians and nurses at Chastain Memorial Hospital as they encounter personal and professional problems while fighting for their patient’s health. Here’s all you need to know about The Resident’s forthcoming season.</p><h2>The first episode of Season 6 of The Resident will be released next week.</h2><p>Season 6 of FOX’s The Resident will launch on Wednesday, September 20 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, with the opening episode titled Two Hearts. Amy Holden Jones, Antoine Fuqua, Phillip Noyce, Oly Obst, David Boorstein, and Todd Harthan serve as executive producers.</p><p>The following is the official summary for the forthcoming episode:</p><p>“When Padma’s pregnancy takes a perilous turn, the physicians band together to find a solution and look to Ian for a miracle; Conrad makes a major choice, and Devon runs his own clinical studies at Chastain.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Resident-2.jpg alt="The Resident" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Matt Czuzhry will play Dr. Conrad Hawkins, Manish Dayal will play Dr. Devon Pravesh, Bruce Greenwood will play Dr. Randolph Bell, Jane Leeves will play Dr. Kit Voss, Malcolm-Jamal Warner will play Dr. AJ Austin, Jessica Lucas will play Dr. Billie Sutton, Anuja Joshi will play Dr. Leela Devi, Andrew McCarthy will play Dr. Ian Sullivan, and Kae Ronayne will play Dr. Cad</p><h2>Recap of the Season 5 finale</h2><p>The Resident season 5 finale, titled All Neon Moon, aired on May 17, 2022. Rob Corn directed it, while Amy Holden Jones and Andrew Chapman wrote it.&nbsp;The episode began with a flashback to when Conrad and Nic first hired Marion to babysit Gigi while they went on a date. Meanwhile, Irving attempted to get Devon to speak with Leela since Devon had chosen to leave. A pregnant mother arrived with her kid, apparently suffering from pulmonary edema. She was suffering from heart failure, and her heart was unable to pump enough blood for her and the baby.</p><p>The physicians, on the other hand, had a bold plan that would almost certainly fail and end in the death of the pregnant mother and/or her infant. Leela and Padma went to the doctor to find out whether Padma was pregnant, which she was.&nbsp;Cade was released and went to see her father, who wished to do the same following his fall. Conrad suspected Ian had an ulcer but wanted him to be tested further. He then discussed sorrow and Nic with Winston since he had gone through something similar with his girlfriend. He advised him to cherish the memories.</p><p>Cade realized her father had pancreatic cancer, which no one knew about, and they had to operate on him since it was operable and only Bell could do it.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Billie had a flare-up, but his eyesight was unaffected, so he was cleared for the OR. Mrs. Alvarez’s illness caused marcoditis, and her heart couldn’t beat for two days, so AJ and Devon suggested terminating the pregnancy. However, despite the challenges and hazards, the husband chose to place his wife on ECMO.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Resident-1.jpg alt="The Resident" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Cade confided in Conrad, and he consoled her by telling her about how things used to be with his father. He held Cade and pondered on Nic’s memories of him holding someone who mistook him for someone else, and when he clarified, they spoke about how much they loved each other.&nbsp;Cade praised Billie for rescuing her father and hoped the cancer was gone. The two then discussed their love for Conrad. Devon encouraged Conrad to build new memories, and Conrad remembered how he made Nic swear that if anything happened to him, she’d find love again, and she did the same.</p><h2>Take a look at the trailer for the forthcoming season.</h2><p>The official trailer for The Resident season 6 debuted last month, giving audiences a taste of what’s to come. The series will likely continue to highlight the everyday heroics of healthcare professionals.&nbsp;Conrad faced life without his beloved wife Nic and raising their daughter as a single father in the previous season. But now that he’s dating, he’s caught up in a love triangle with Billie and Cade. Devon and Leela just reconnected, and Kit and Randolph recently got engaged.&nbsp;Season 6 of The Resident premieres on FOX on Tuesday, September 20.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroZ1dp7K0tcOepa1lo5qutLvNZm1moaNiwKbAjK2mZpqVYr%2BmuMSaqp6cXaS7brLOsWY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kate-hudson-open-up-about-her-relationship-with-her-ex-husband-chris-robinson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kate Hudson Open Up About Her Relationship With Her Ex-Husband Chris Robinson">&larr;
