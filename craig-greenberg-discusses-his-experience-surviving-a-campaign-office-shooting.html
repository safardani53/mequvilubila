Even though the rounds were meant at the politician, he escaped the premises unscathed. A gunshot touched his shirt but missed the target, it was subsequently discovered. Officials reacted to the event after receiving a report of an “active aggressor.”</p><p>Quintez Brown, 21, was charged with attempted murder and four wanton endangerment counts. Craig Greenberg is a Democratic mayoral candidate in Louisville. The candidate describes himself as “a proud Louisvillian, spouse, parent, entrepreneur, and community leader,” according to his campaign website. The Democrat allegedly began his mayoral campaign in 2021 and has amassed a sizable funding advantage in his bid to replace incumbent Mayor Greg Fischer. Greenberg is a lawyer who attended Jefferson County Public Schools and Harvard Law School.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Craig-Greenberg-2.jpg alt="Craig Greenberg" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Before entering politics, he worked as the CEO of 21c Museum Hotels. He started the Louisville-based firm with over 1000 employees and is renowned for revitalizing Main Street and other metropolitan districts. Greenberg helped save 111 Whiskey Row from a fire. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Louisville. During his tenure on the board, the politician spearheaded attempts to uncover the previous university president’s illicit financial activities. He also sought to prevent a projected 5% rise in student tuition prices.</p><p dir=ltr lang=und><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HTqKWWr1df</a></p><p>— Craig Greenberg (@RunWithCraig) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 15, 2022</a></p><p>The Louisville native also served on the boards of Metro United Way and the Louisville Jewish Community Center, as well as the March of Dimes’ March for Babies. He’s also a co-owner of the Louisville-based sports entertainment company Ohio Valley Wrestling. According to reports, Craig Greenberg believes in “thinking big, working hard, and making things happen.” According to his website, the politician has spent his career “making aspirations become a reality” and hopes to bring the same spirit to Louisville. For the last 21 years, the Democrat has been married to schoolteacher Rachel. Daniel and Benjamin are the couple’s two kids.</p><h2>Craig Greenberg discusses his experience surviving a campaign office shooting.</h2><p>Quintez Brown, a local activist, came into Craig Greenberg’s campaign&nbsp;headquarters in downtown Louisville on February 14, 2022, and tried to shoot the politician. The Democrat was uninjured and spoke about the event later that day at a press conference:</p><p>“I am fortunate. Our crew is really fortunate. A guy entered our office. When we met him, he began firing at me.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Incredibly thankful for the support.<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/C3h5vvn4tD</a></p><p>— Craig Greenberg (@RunWithCraig) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 9, 2022</a></p><p>He said that five members of his team were in the office at the time of the event and valiantly barred the door, forcing the suspect to leave. According to the lawmaker, the rifle was “aimed squarely” at him and grazed his clothing:</p><p>“Despite the fact that one bullet touched my sweater and blouse, no one was injured, and we are really thankful for our safety. We’ve been rocked, but we’re safe.”</p><p></p><p>According to Louisville Police Chief Erika Shields and President of the Local Metro Council David James, Greenberg was the intended victim of the shooting intended victim. While Shields referred to everyone on the scene as “lucky,” the latter referred to the situation as an “assassination attempt.” The guy was apprehended 10 minutes later, half a mile from the campaign headquarters. He had a 9mm magazine in his trousers pocket and a weapon, handgun case, and magazines in a drawstring bag. Chief Shields thought the attack was motivated by politics, Greenberg’s Jewish identity, or the suspect’s mental illness.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Craig Greenberg</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaq5mZnHqovsSepZudopx6pbXSnKysq5Woeqm10macsaiVp7amusKeZKytoqu2t7XNoGSaZZOWurGtyKClZqeWm7aksYysn6inpJ67qHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dorothy-breininger.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Dorothy Breininger net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr;
