This month’s publication of <a href=#>Prince Harry’s memoir</a> Spare is bleak as Saturn squashes the King’s sensitive nature.</p><p>And the <a href=#>coronation date</a> of May 6 is just hours after an eclipsed Full Moon, marking a turbulent reign.</p><p>From July the rebel planet Uranus, a radical force for change, means <a href=#>Charles </a>will go through a time of challenges.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p><strong>PRINCE WILLIAM:</strong> Neptune’s disappointing influence speaks of sadness over his flyaway brother.</p><p>However, in spring he comes out of his Cancerian shell into a radiant 2023. From the coronation onwards he’ll carve out a strong platform as <a href=#>Prince of Wales</a>.</p><p>Autumn is huge for making a global impact.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/embargoed-publication-uk-newspapers-48-761542375.jpg><p><strong>PRINCE HARRY:</strong> Volatile Uranus arrives on his moon, a once-in-a-lifetime scenario which marks out a year of seismic change that will see a home move and a clear cut with the wider family.</p><p>The coronation, with its lunar eclipse on <a href=#>Harry</a>’s Saturn and Midheaven, closes the book on his old life.</p><p>He will march forward into a life that is free and independent from the royals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/catherine-princess-wales-visits-maternity-765871395.jpg><p><strong>KATE, PRINCESS OF WALES:</strong> <a href=#>Kate</a>’s year has the hand of destiny upon it, as if she’s been prepared for this moment to step out with new-found confidence.</p><p>Even though she is a reserved sun sign, Capricorn, we are going to see a different side of her – more accessible and spontaneous. June is her month to captivate the hearts and minds of the public.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/embargoed-publication-uk-newspapers-24-755282151.jpg><p><strong>DUCHESS OF SUSSEX: </strong><a href=#>Meghan </a>is gung-ho and in ­jubilant spirits in January.</p><p>She’s centre stage in March as Jupiter levels up her sense of success and 2023 puts her in warrior queen mode.</p><p>There’s a home move to another property or location coming, and the mid-October eclipse on Pluto is a wake-up call around family.</p><p><strong>PRINCE ANDREW:</strong> As Saturn moves on to <a href=#>Andrew</a>’s Sun in Pisces for the first time in 29 years, he’s facing a time that is stamped with karma – the consequences of ­previous actions.</p><p>Coupled with this, Pluto – the planet of power and disempowerment – is on his Mars and Venus, meaning Andrew will experience circumstances beyond his control.

But in March, Pluto leaves Capricorn and he loses status or power.</p><p>So, until May he needs to be careful of injuries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jude-bellingham-england-poses-official-781083375.jpg><p><strong>JUDE BELLINGHAM</strong>: <a href=#>Jude </a>had his sun in Cancer with Mars in Pisces at the time of his birth, which means he is very emotional.</p><p>He is someone who plays using his feelings so he needs a manager who understands that.</p><p>In terms of a transfer I think <a href=#>Liverpool </a>will be his next destination.</p><p><a href=#>Real Madrid </a>will try to get him, but I feel because of his sun in ­Cancer he is a homebody at heart.</p><p><strong>JACK GREALISH:</strong> <a href=#>Jack </a>is a Virgo with Mars in Scorpio and this means he’s not firing on all cylinders – but his form will bounce back from March to May.</p><p>However, he has a Saturn return coming up, which tends to be a difficult time.</p><p>This means Jack may experience relationship turbulence in the second half of 2023 and his football may suffer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/england-captain-ben-stokes-celebrates-782387228-1.jpg><p><strong>BEN STOKES:</strong> A year of steady progress beckons. He’s revolutionising cricket and as a Gemini he is being supported by the planets in 2023, although not in 2024.</p><p>I don’t think <a href=#>Ben </a>will quite lead the team to the heights of 2022 but he will build firm foundations for the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2022-leah-williamson-england-poses-785624668.jpg><p><strong>WOMEN’S WORLD CUP:</strong> When the<a href=#> World Cup</a> takes place this year, Venus is going backwards in the sky, known as retrograde.</p><p>This is going to cause problems and, sadly for the ladies, it means it will be one step forward and two steps back.

Towards the end of the year he will have news surrounding an addition to his family.</p><p>In 2023 he’s going to be the happiest he’s ever been and he will continue to enjoy ­support and love from family and friends.</p><p>By the end of next year he will step away temporarily from the public eye.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/NINTCHDBPICT000782287610-1.jpg><p><strong>STORMZY:</strong> The past is the past when it comes to love, and I don’t see a rekindling with <a href=#>Maya Jama</a>.</p><p>Instead, I see <a href=#>Stormzy </a>becoming more in touch with his spirituality.</p><p>Career-wise he’s got a great year ahead. I see him working with some powerful ­people, and some kind of collab with <a href=#>Adele</a>.</p><p><strong>DUA LIPA:</strong> <a href=#>She </a>may have had panic and stress in her life and phe last year was tough for her. But this year she’s on the right path.</p><p>I see her family giving her a lot of strength. Anything she does around design and ­creativity will be amazing.</p><p>I see a lot of work around branding and marketing. I only get positive vibrations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/eaf3e244-295f-407e-83a1-9062109c5f6d.jpg><p><strong>HELEN SKELTON:</strong> Will continue to grow in self-belief and confidence.</p><p><a href=#>She </a>will become open to <a href=#>new love</a> and new beginnings around August.</p><p>The new guy I see later this year is a “keeper” and there will be talk of weddings in 2024 and a little girl.</p><p>Within the <a href=#>BBC </a>there will be numerous show offers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/da4ce442-073d-4f22-8872-6c19dba07efd.jpg><p><strong>BRITNEY SPEARS</strong> She will have a <a href=#>new lease of life</a>, it’s like she has gone back to being 21.</p><p>I see her being very “together”, in control.
