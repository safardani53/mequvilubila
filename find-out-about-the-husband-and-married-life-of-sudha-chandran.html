She had a few injuries and some fractures but due to the negligence of the hospital staff, she had to amputate her leg. Despite having only one leg she has made her mark as an established Bharatnatyam dancer. Wow!! A true inspiration to disabled people.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-115 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-901 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Sudha Chandran now <span>plays the role of Yamini&nbsp;</span>in a popular TV drama . Well, we all know her very well from the television series and films, but how much do you guys know her on a personal level. Let’s take a dive into her personal life and get to know her better.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Sudha Chandran is married to Ravi Dang</h2><p>Sudha Chandran met her husband Ravi on the set of the movie . Sudha wanted a man who would put her first and love her despite her disability. Sudha was very insecure at first because of her deformity and thought that she wouldn’t find a man who will love her. But Ravi proved her wrong and managed to win her heart. Well, talking about Ravi, he is a by birth and is an assistant director in the Hindi film industry.</p><p>&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-121 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Before Sudha met Ravi, she was having a very hard time because of her deformity. She was struggling to find work at that time. After she met Ravi, <a href=#>they initially started their relationship as friends</a> and Ravi always kept motivating her saying that she can do it. As a friend, Ravi even asked his superior to give Sudha a role in the movie. After seeing all the effort that Ravi made to make her feel special, Sudha’s feelings for Ravi started to change into love. They dated for about 8 years before they got married.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Sudha and Ravi tied the knot in 1994 in traditional South Indian style. Sudha has once said that her husband is a pillar of strength for her. As a matter a fact her husband is the one who handles her dance school in Mumbai. It looks like the two have understood each other very well.</p><p>The couple has been married for 22 years now, it is a great milestone and they still seem very happy. The way their relationship just shows how much love they have for each other. It is not easy to spend that long period with the same person even if you are in love, but this couple has managed to do so. They truly are an inspiration to other couples and have set a very good example for this generation about getting&nbsp;committed in a relationship.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2>Sudha and Ravi have no children</h2><p>This pair, despite being together for so long don’t have any children. Both of them are career-oriented, and their busy schedule and love for work may be the reason for not having any children (we don't know any particular reason for this).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>We wish the couple all the luck for their future and hope their marriage lasts forever.</p><p>Please leave your comments below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FSrZirnJ%2Bie6S7zGidoqaUYry2wIyamaitpGLBqbGMoaysmpGjsW6tzZ1kppmip7amsIyloJ%2BdXaSzbr%2FUnZ%2BaZZOdrq%2Bw0Zql</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-troy-brown-jr-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Troy Brown Jr. Dating Now">&larr;
