The comedian was initially a single mother to Parker, but her former wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kelli Carpenter</a> later became his legal parent, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Parker enrolled in the Valley Forge Military Academy and is currently in the Marines. "How do you annoy your left-wing, liberal, pacifist mother?

Although they appear to have reconnected, The View alum and her eldest daughter haven't always had the easiest relationship, as they were estranged on and off throughout Chelsea's teenage and early adulthood years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2015, O'Donnell announced Chelsea had gone missing from their New York home. She was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>found a week later</a> and subsequently moved to Wisconsin to live with her birth mother, Deanna Micoley. "Chelsea made a decision when she turned 18 that she wanted to go to her birth mother. This was her choice," O'Donnell's publicist Cindi Berger told PEOPLE at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The comedian maintained her wish for her family was one for "love and peace."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Chelsea sat down for an on-air interview with Inside Edition alongside her then-husband Nick Alliegro. "Growing up, I never really got along with her and then once she kicked me out, I was just kind of done," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>she said</a>. "I miss the rest of my family a lot but I think there is some much-needed space between me and Rosie.

"It's very trite, but it's what everyone says — when you're a grandparent, it's like [having] a baby times a million. And that's what it felt like."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, the star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opened up about her relationship with her daughter</a> on The Talk, saying, "I think with my relationship with my daughter, Chelsea, (the relationship being tested did make it stronger) because we went through some really public troubled times. She's doing better now and we're both communicating with each other. When somebody does something unforgivable to you and you can forgive them and they can forgive you, there's a kind of grace that descends upon the both of you, within that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chelsea is now a mom of four.

You were in a baseball game, and you were a teenager,' " she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>shared with Page Six</a>.

She just didn't really inform us, for really anything."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">O'Donnell readily admitted Vivienne's childhood "wasn't a normal (one) like all of her friends."

Rounds sought sole custody of Dakota, but then tragically <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>died of suicide</a> in 2017.

She teaches me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The comedian also recalled the moment that Dakota asked to meet her birth mother.

I just wanted you to know I'm the kid that was in there, and when I got born, my mommy held me and I squeezed her pinkie, and I am with her. So I just want to let you know that's what happened to me.
