Whitlock falls into the latter category.</p><p>The famed podcaster wants to stay far away from marriage.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In an interview with Colin Cowherd on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Herd</a>&nbsp;in 2016, the sports journalist&nbsp;put forward his take on the advantages of being single instead of sharing his plans on getting married.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Cowherd&nbsp;gave examples of some personalities who became successful after getting married and urged Whitlock to settle down with a wife.</p><p>Interestingly though,&nbsp;Whitlock quickly gave a befitting reply to the host. He gave an&nbsp;example of&nbsp;professional footballer Chip Kelly who is unmarried and has a successful career.</p><p>He opined the baller was successful because he could focus on football 24/7.&nbsp;"He thinks it gives him a great advantage in it," Whitlock added. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to the 54-year-old author, he has more time to think than his competitors, who always worry about&nbsp;their wives and kids.</p><p>Not only that, but he also expressed his opinion on how his singlehood helped him to grow professionally with no distractions from a wife.</p><p>I think it’s an advantage in my career. I have more time to think than my competitors. So I tell people all the time. It’s not that I am smarter than anybody I just got more time to think while you are thinking about your life and kids.</p><p>Whitlock further explained his problem with post-marriage life and having a wife. The problem? He's scared his life will be out of balance. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I think I’ll be honest with you. I have lived long enough to know it’s not an advantage. Your life is out of balance.</p><p>He admitted that having a wife would put him in a better place, but mentioned that his problem was he would "wanna&nbsp;relax at home and she will be like let’s hit the club."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Jason&nbsp;Whitlock Had&nbsp;A&nbsp;Girlfriend</h2><p>Even though the radio personality has a problem exchanging vows, he surely didn’t want to stay away from getting love. As per his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweet</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;July 2015, he once had a girlfriend.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>Reminds me when I told a gf: "You don't ever have to worry about catching me at a drive-thru window again." <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://t.co/2eD23zUjg8</a> — Jason Whitlock (@WhitlockJason) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">July 31, 2015</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The said relationship remained a mystery as he never officially spoke about it.&nbsp;However, one of his Fox Sports columns reads that he is a fan of 'June-December <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">romances</a>.' He wrote: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But a blossoming Mayflower certainly could be fertilized into a special, 28-year-old bouquet by a patient and attentive gardener.</p><p>For those of you who don't know what a June-December romance (or popularly known as May-December)&nbsp;is, it is&nbsp;an age-old term for a romantic relationship between two people with a considerable age difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Whitlock further shared in the column that men like him are somehow attracted to younger women.</p><p>Every man I know has a little Captain in him. We see a pretty young thang working her way through nursing or cosmetology school and it’s just in our nature to pay a cellphone bill, a car note or get her nails done. It’s what we do.</p><h2>Is Jason&nbsp;Whitlock Gay?</h2><p>The former Fox TV sports <a href=# rel=follow>journalist</a>&nbsp;has kept his private life behind the curtains and never really spoke about it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This has raised many questions regarding his sexuality, but didn’t necessarily mean he is gay. Whitlock never really gave air to the&nbsp;rumors; however, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated in 2016</a> that he fully supported&nbsp;and stood behind the LGBTQ community.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He extended his view regarding <a href=# rel="follow noopener">this topic</a>&nbsp;in the sports context.</p><p>According to the sports columnist, the sports world needs a prominent role model like Muhammad Ali to be a trailblazer&nbsp;to remove some of this hate and fear of people relating to the homosexual community.</p><p>In sports, there are opportunities, we’ve seen it for sports to be a leader in social change, and clearly, I don’t want to avoid this man or this tragedy affected the LGBT community, and there’s a reason why the LGBT community wants the sports world to embrace people of the LGBT community.</p><p>He added they needed a role model for gay and lesbian athletes. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnmpbAsLqMsJ%2BirJyksKx5z6ucn52iqHqkrdGenKtln6uys3nMmqmroZWZeri1xZ5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kendall-jenner-takes-devin-booker-camping-documents-woodsy-bang.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kendall Jenner Takes Devin Booker Camping, Documents Woodsy Bang-a-Thon With Racy Pics">&larr;
