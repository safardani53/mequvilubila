I don't know if I would because of my mental health.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"I don't know if I'm sure about it. But the others? Absolutely."</p><p>Renee is still in contact with her fellow Mob Wives and reckon if the price is right, anything could happen.</p><p>Karen Gravano starred in 'Families of the Mafia' which screened on MTV and bagged a second series while the word coming from the rest of the original cast is positive.</p><p>"I just sat with Karen recently," said Renee.</p><p>"I said make me an offer. I can review and then we'll talk about it. Karen's doing well. Everybody's doing their thing. I don't think they bring everyone back but I think they bring the main people back."</p><p>Mob Wives finished after six rollercoaster seasons in 2016 - but even though Renee would be interested in a reboot, she doesn't miss the mobster life at all.</p><p>With ex-husband Hector Pagan recently released on parole after being sentenced to 11 years in jail for murder in 2014, she needed a fresh start in the Floridian sun.</p><p>Her life is vastly different today - but Renee wouldn't have it any other way.</p><p>Yet does she miss anything about being a mob wife?</p><p>‌"I miss my checks being picked up," she said with a smile.</p><p>"I missed those gifts. But no, I don't miss the prison visits. I don't miss the commentary. I don't miss writing letters all the time. I don't miss any of it. You know, people talk about the mafia being so glamorous. The only thing glamorous about the mafia would be the furs, the diamonds, the big homes."</p><p>For now, she's zoned in on improving her mental health and winning her battle with addiction.</p><p>Leaving New York was key.</p><p>"It’s part of my recovery," she said when talking about the reasons for her recent move.</p><p>"I have two sisters but I don't get along with my family, there is always drama but I lost my father four years ago and my life changed drastically.</p><p>"I just wanted to get away from New York It's so dark, New York is dark. And COVID destroyed that city.</p><p>"I was watching my grandson suffer from it. And now he’s developed anxiety and OCD. I just wanted to escape because I suffer with anxiety and depression and to watch a little boy go through that too?"</p><p>Her journey towards sobriety has been rocky but there is light at the end of a very long, treacherous tunnel.</p><p>Renee's interventionist has played a large part in her resurgence although like anyone dragged into the hell of addiction, she never looks too far ahead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/shot-us-sun-exclusive-pics-799334435.jpg><p>"I don't count days. And I do that on purpose because days give me pressure," she admitted.</p><p>"So every day is a new day for me. And I think that's the best way for me to look at it. But it definitely puts a lot of perspective but there are days that I'd love to self-medicate after watching how horrible the world is.</p><p>"I just know I have to keep on keeping on because somebody else is looking at me to do the right thing.</p><p>‌"I was never a drinker, it was more that I just wanted to go to bed. I had a Xanax issue. Back in the day sure, I partied with cocaine and champagne, but it became Xanax after that.</p><p>‌"I wake up every day I hit the floor, I pray and I thank God for another day. And every day further away from that makes me a lot stronger and a lot healthier for somebody else."</p><p>‌Renee is certainly keeping busy - she has a new memoir in the works and a TV return in 'The Fairy Mob Mother' - a feel-good show aimed at helping others.</p><p>She's desperate to give something back to those less fortunate.</p><p>"While in recovery, I had the opportunity not too long ago to speak to 167 people in treatment centers," Renee recalled.</p><p>"So to hear the people say that I've made a difference in their life, I cried because I don't even think I can make a difference in my own life.</p><p>"To hear other people say that I made a difference it makes me feel that this wasn't for nothing.</p><p>‌"How do I think I made a difference in their life?</p><p>‌"By just being real, by being open and honest.</p><p>"Look, I'm human I f**k up. I fall and get back up. You know, I might make it from here to the bushes and then I might trip.</p><p>"But I'm human. And I'm not embarrassed to say it."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/vh1-programme-press-handout-661643-1.jpg><p>‌</p><p>‌</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZW19doCTaKmeppWaeqi%2BwLOgmqafYrqwroywoK%2Bdo2K%2FpsDUq6VmnKKqtG60xKWjaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-love-boat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Love Boat Season 5 Episodes">&larr;
