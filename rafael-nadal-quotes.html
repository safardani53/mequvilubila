It’s different.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“I love the beach. I love the sea. All my life I live within – in front of the sea.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“I am very lucky because when I come back home, I have a completely normal life. I can relax, playing golf, fishing – doing what I want. I know when I finish a tournament, I am going to relax at home.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“My motivation is tomorrow, just one day at a time, right?”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“The glory is being happy. The glory is not winning here or winning there. The glory is enjoying practicing, enjoy every day, enjoying to work hard, trying to be a better player than before.”―<a href=#> Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“You fight, you try your best, but if you lose, you don’t have to break five racquets and smash up the locker room. You can do those things, but when you’ve finished, nothing’s changed. You’ve still lost. If something positive came from that, I probably would do it. But I see only negativity.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rafael-Nadal-with-his-precious-award.jpeg><p>“I will do as I usually do. Tomorrow is going to be a day like any other day.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“It’s not the time to look for excuses.”―<a href=#> Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“My parents’ divorce made an important change in my life. It affected me.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“Some people get very confused about my game. They think it’s better if the court is slow, because I have a good defence. But the faster it is, the better for me. My spin is more painful for my opponents, my aggressive game works better.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I appreciate a lot in this life; the things you cannot buy. Life is only once. I am happy being here and all the things that are a risk I normally avoid.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“I admire a lot of people, but in terms of sport I’ve always loved the mentality of Tiger Woods on a golf course. I always love his eyes when he’s setting himself and focusing on his decision; he has a really strong, focused face and believes that he can make the shot.”―<a href=#> Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“I am happy with being a tennis player and the choice I took when I was 12. But clearly, if I wouldn’t have been a tennis player, I would have loved to be a soccer player. But again, I am happy with the choice I made.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><p><strong>14th of 85 Rafael Nadal Quotes</strong></p><p>“We’ll try and be very aggressive, we’ll try and speed up and change gears, and we’ll see who’s going to win.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“Tennis is a hard sport. There is a lot of competition all year and you play alone.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I am not the most courageous guy in the world outside of the court. Being alone in the dark is something I don’t like.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“I’m ambidextrous when I eat. But playing tennis right-handed – I can’t do it. I’m clueless.”―<a href=#> Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“Even if I have already peaked, I have to believe I can improve. I wake up every morning, and go to practice, with the illusion that I’m going to get better that day.”―<a href=#> Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“If you don’t lose, you cannot enjoy the victories. So I have to accept both things.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I always work with a goal – and the goal is to improve as a player and a person. That, finally, is the most important thing of all.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“My motivation and aspiration is the same, being number one or being number five. So that’s the truth. And my goal is the same – it’s to always be happy playing, it’s to enjoy the game and improve always.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“As a tennis player you can win and you can lose, and you have to be ready for both. I practised self-control as a kid. But as you get older they both – winning and losing – get easier.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“Hard courts are very negative for the body. I know the sport is a business and creating these courts is easier than clay or grass, but I am 100 per cent sure it is wrong.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I’ve stayed calm when I’m winning and I’ve stayed calm when I’ve lost. Tennis is a sport where we have a lot of tournaments every week, so you can’t celebrate a lot when you have big victories, and you cannot get too down when you’re losing, as in a few days you’ll be in the next tournament and you’ll have to be ready with that.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p><strong><a href=#>Top 56 Naomi Osaka Quotes</a></strong></p><p>“I always like to do the things that I think are right. I am not trying to be a model, I am trying to be myself and do the right things. If what I am doing is a model, or is an example, is the right example, I am very happy, but I don’t pretend that.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“The family is very important. They make me feel good always because if I won, when I started to be famous, the relationship never changed with my friends and family.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I have the same bedroom I’ve always had. It’s clean and tidy when I get home, and after two or three days it gets messy and my mother nags me.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“It’s important to have people around you with enough confidence to say if you are not acting in a good way. Normally, when you are at the top, people say everything is fantastic. Probably in that moment it is what you want to hear, but it’s best to be reminded how to act properly.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I am decidedly unfriendly during a golf game, from the first hole to the last.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“It’s more a tennis problem than a mental problem. The transition is difficult. It depends how much time you have. Playing on grass can sometimes be a bit of a lottery.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“New York is a special place; it’s a city that I love.”― Rafael Nadal</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rafael-Nadal-with-his-love.jpeg><p>“In tennis, because of the way it’s scored, I don’t think that scoring one point out of luck is ever decisive in winning. But, of course, it depends on the moment.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I think the tennis is only a game. You can lose. You can win. After that? In life, there are much more important things than tennis.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“It’s hard to say, ‘I don’t believe in God.’ I would love to know if God exists. But it’s a very difficult thing for me to believe.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I started to travel like this at the age of 15 so for me, it’s normal. Some days you get tired and you feel, ‘I want to stay at home a little bit more,’ but it’s only the moment.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“I have been learning English on the road since I started when I was 15, so it is a slow process but making some progress. Now I think I am much more comfortable with my English. However, it is difficult, still, when I speak about something that is not tennis.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><p><strong>37th of 85 Rafael Nadal Quotes</strong></p><p>“I appreciate a lot in this life; the things you cannot buy. Life is only once.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I am a guy who likes to do what I am doing with passion, whether it’s a soccer match with friends or golf.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“To be a friend means that they are always there, for the good or the bad.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“For me, it is important to win titles and for that I need to work hard, stay healthy and be able to compete. The rest, I always say, it comes.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“My parents’ divorce made an important change in my life. It affected me. After that, when I can’t play Wimbledon, it was tough. For one month I was outside the world.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“You just try to play tough and focus point for point. Sounds so boring, but it’s the right thing to do out there.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“Is only a tennis match. At the end, that’s life.

That’s painful, because always is tough to lose, but well, that’s sport. You win, you lose.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“You know, a lot of things changed. What never changed is the illusion to keep playing tennis, the illusion to keep doing well the things, and the illusion to be in a good position of the ranking and play these kind of matches.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p><strong><a href=#>Top 70 Andy Murray Quotes</a></strong></p><p>“I’m really, really emotional.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I tried to find a solution to the problem that I had, tried to find a way to start playing better.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I always wanted to be honest with myself and to those who have had faith in me.”― <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“Every year I go to Broadway to see a musical – I like the music. I saw ‘Mamma Mia;’ I saw ‘Les Miserables;’ I saw ‘Phantom of the Opera’ like six, seven times.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I think when you compete every week, when you play under pressure daily, you find your rituals to be 100 percent focused on what you’re doing.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I always had the theory that the most important thing is be happy, enjoy what are you doing, and be fresh mentally.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I am not the most courageous guy in the world outside of the court.”―<a href=#> Rafael Nadal</a></p><p>“I think I am a complete player.

In everything else, not very.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I love the crowds in Miami. I feel that is one of the tournaments where I get more support.

Everybody does stupid things.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I was passionate about soccer. I still am. Odd, though – playing soccer always made me much more anxious than playing tennis.

I still don’t know why.”― Rafael Nadal</p><p>“I am lucky because my family are comfortably off.
