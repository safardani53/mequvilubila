A week after that, she courageously came out in an Instagram post where she admitted that she was struggling with "postpartum emotions".&nbsp;</p><p>However, soon after&nbsp;on 7 August 2017, Cnn's Poppy Harlow responded to the tennis star's honesty by thanking her. She explained how Serena's post about motherhood and postpartum resonated with many mothers including Poppy herself. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also opened up how she feels it every day but never talked about it prior to that moment.

She joined the network in 2008 and served as an anchor for CNNMoney.com and reported in for CNN, CNN International and HLN.</p><p>In 2013, Poppy, a current CNN Newsroom anchor, was once criticized for appearing to have sympathy for a pair of high school football players who were convicted as rapists.</p><h3><strong>Poppy Harlow's Short Bio: Age, Ethnicity, Nationality</strong></h3><p>Poppy Harlow was born on 2 May 1982<span> </span>in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to parents, James Lee Harlow and&nbsp;Louise Baird.&nbsp;She belongs to American nationality and possesses white ethnicity.

Then work. Then life.</p><p>Then laundry and dinner. Life is a little messier – but it is messy in the best way” confessed the mother of two. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W8sbzYZp%2BaqpykxG6vzadkppmip7amsIyhrKyakaOxbq3GnmSsmZyWv7p5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpecGambJlo567qr%2FAZpmampOesG6x06GlopuZqcZuusCtoKimkaG2tcWNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hearts-rangers-live-stream-free-tv-channel-kick-off-time-team-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hearts vs Rangers live stream FREE: What TV channel, team news, and kick-off time for huge Scottish ">&larr;
